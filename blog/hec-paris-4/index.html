<p>We’re halfway done with the phase one of the Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship program at <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris. This post will summarize two new courses that I’ve taken and passed: New Product Development and Organizational Design and Management. The common these of these two courses is organizing teams and incentivizing them, hence the name of the&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>##New Product&nbsp;Development</p>
<p>The New Product Development course is, as you can get from the name, about developing new products, but those new products don’t have to be completely new products. In fact, most of the times when companies develop new products, they are extending their current lines of products, or enhancing existing&nbsp;products. </p>
<p>In the course we’ve learned to ask three main questions. Is the market real? Is the product real question? Can our company be competitive? Or is it worth doing? Or in a short version: Is a real? Can we win it? Is it worth&nbsp;doing?</p>
<p>We’ve learned how to apply the net perceived value or <span class="caps">NPV</span>. We’ve learned about the Stage Gate process, concurrent engineering, the Agile process, the selectionism and parallel trials methods, learning and iteration methods and many more techniques. As you can already see from all the names of the methods, the course has a lot of refences and give students good understanding on what is out there and the next steps on where to find&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>When developing new products, there are various types of uncertainties: variation, known risks and unforeseeable uncertainty. In the end, there is no right or wrong solution. It’s all about the strategy at a particular company at a particular time for a particular line of products and developments. Most often, you will work with a portfolio of processes and portfolio of products, some of them short term and some of them long term to mitigate any risks of losing the strategic market share, or increasing the&nbsp;revenue.</p>
<p>And then of course, we’ve learned how to organize different teams according to different types of new product developments. For example, using colocation company that has more connections. The main takeaway of this course is not all new products worth, developing and not all new products are equally exciting and beneficial to the company and the business,&nbsp;period.</p>
<h2 id="organizational-design-and-management">Organizational Design and&nbsp;Management</h2>
<p>The organizational design and management is weirdly named. I still don’t quite understand the full meaning of the title. Nevertheless, the course was fun to watch because two professors of <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris were moving from location to location and interviewing different people and they went role playing (e.g., the case of the onion chopping in restaurant in Paris for&nbsp;close). </p>
<p>As far as the content, the course contained a lot of references to methods and teqniques. Also, there were a lot of insights and ideas in this course, including how to identify your competitive advantage or value created, using the business model canvas, or creating an incentive plan for your employees intrinsic and extrinsic&nbsp;motivation.</p>
<p>We looked at Superamas who have a lot of intrinsic motivation for their arts project. We looked at different org structures such as divisional and functional. And lastly, we looked at vertical, horizontal and geographical&nbsp;scaling.</p>
<p>The main takeaway of this course could be summed up as <strong>you don’t have to reinvent the wheel, when you’re designing your organization and management</strong>. Instead, you can tap into existing patterns experiences frameworks and&nbsp;knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="hec-paris-entrepreneurs-panel-and-alumni-gathering"><span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris Entrepreneurs Panel and Alumni&nbsp;Gathering</h2>
<p>I visited a life event in San Francisco, organized by the executive <span class="caps">HTC</span> powers organization. They brought Executive MBA students from Europe (HEC EMBA Entrepreneurship Major Class of 2020), and also they organized an entrepreneurship panel of speakers: Danny Hamadi, Sheryle Bolton, and Carlos Diaz. The event was in an old building next to the famous Fairmont Hotel, where typically presidents stay when they visit San&nbsp;Francisco.</p>
<p> <img src="/blog/hec-paris-4/IMG_0266.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>We enjoyed networking and splendid city views. Then we listened to the speakers and had some wine&amp;cheese and more networking. It was interesting to meet with the fellow matter of science and innovation and entrepreneurship programs students, but also with full-time <span class="caps">MBA</span> and Executive MBA students. A lot of the people want to move into the product management roles or start their own companies. That’s understandable because typically those are the riskier, and more challenging problem to solve, for which you can also have more impact and get more rewards. Here’s a picture from the&nbsp;event.</p>

<p>The <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris community is very strong internationally. There are 300 alumni in the Bay Area but tens of thousands in Europe and&nbsp;Asia. </p>
<p>I offered Vincent Murezlle (Executive Director of the <span class="caps">HEC</span> USA Representative Office) to host the next visiting class of HEC Paris at my company Indeed in San Francisco and for me to teach a lecture to them. We’ll see how it&nbsp;goes. </p>
