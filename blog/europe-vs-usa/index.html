          <section class="content"><p>Last two years I’ve been traveling extensively. I spoke at 17 conferences. A lot of my traveling was to Europe in countries such as Sweden, Norway, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Iceland. Of course tourism is not the same as immigration but I would like to reflect and sum up some advantages of staying in&nbsp;Europe. </p>
<ul>
<li>In Europe, hotels are better designed, maintained and sometimes cheaper. For example, I stayed Smarthotel Oslo for just $60 <span class="caps">USD</span> which was nice and within a 5-minute walk from the King’s Palace. The terrible Days Inn in the USA is&nbsp;$70-80.</li>
<li>In Europe, hotel breakfast is more like a real breakfast vs. the sad breakfast in the <span class="caps">US</span> hotels. US hotels should be banned by law to call cereals, GMO apple and drip coffee a&nbsp;breakfast.</li>
<li>In Europe, food is more natural and better tasting thanks to less lobbying from Monsanto. There are lots of wild berries&nbsp;too!</li>
<li>In Europe, public transportation is more effective and far&nbsp;reaching.</li>
<li>In Europe, it’s easy to get to the other end of town and typically won’t take you more than 20-40 minutes while it could take you 1-2 hours to get from around the San Francisco Bay&nbsp;Area.</li>
<li>In Europe, there are more smaller neighborhood markets where you can buy groceries vs. having to drive to a giant grocery&nbsp;store.</li>
<li>In Europe, population density is higher in Europe which allows for variety of high quality cafes, coffeeshops vs. cafes closing at 4-5pm in downtown because most people leave to suburbs at the end of the work&nbsp;day.</li>
<li>In Europe, young non-immigrant people work at most service jobs in hotels, airports, and restaurants vs. old or immigrant people working in the same jobs in the <span class="caps">USA</span>. Were do all young Americans go? I guess to play video games or to pretend they study in college (but really just partying and living a good life) by taking student loans instead of working part time and getting free or almost free education as their European&nbsp;peers. </li>
<li>In Europe (especially Eastern Europe), people are more entrepreneurial and flexible. You can negotiate a lot of things like a taxi ride or bargain at the&nbsp;market.</li>
<li>In Europe, people dress nicer (even in&nbsp;airports!).</li>
<li>In Europe, restaurant waiters and store attendants leave you alone and don’t harass with annoying “How was your meal?” or “How may I help&nbsp;you?”</li>
<li>In Europe, you don’t have to leave tips (although I still do but it’s nice to know that it’s not expected and not&nbsp;mandatory).</li>
<li>In Europe, prices are exactly what you pay vs. magically-added-later taxes in the&nbsp;<span class="caps">USA</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the world flatter. It is getting more or less even in terms of advances of technology. It’s no longer the case that in order to live a convenient life you had to move to the <span class="caps">USA</span> or another first-world country like Japan, France or Germany. If the USA had certain advantages in infrastructure and electronic gadgets 15, 10 and even 5 years ago, then right now it’s not longer the case. People have high-speed Internet and the latest Apples. In some places, it’s even the reverse and those places have nicer things than in the&nbsp;USA.</p>
<p>Yes. Infrastructure in the <span class="caps">USA</span> is older than in some other even second or third-world countries of Latin America or Eastern Europe. Things such as hotels, ferry boats, or trains are newer and nicer than in the USA. You see. Those countries didn’t have those things and when they built or invested in them, it happened recently in the past few years. Things are well maintained and better than in the USA. For example, in Kiev and Amsterdam I went to really nice gyms. Five gyms I visited in the East Bay (east of San Francisco) are way, way worse in terms of maintenance, cleanliness and interior design compared to them. The USA gyms are more expensive&nbsp;too. </p>
<p>And yes, not all new is better but when it comes to equipment, and functional things and buildings new is always better. I’m lucky to have the opportunity to visit and travel. It opened me to some of the downsides of living in the San Francisco Bay&nbsp;Area. </p>
