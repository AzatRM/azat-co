            <h2><a href="/blog/happiness/">Pursuit of Happiness as The Major Source of Unhappiness or Why Happiness is Overrated</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/happiness/cactus.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The more I think about happiness, the more I come to the conclusion that it’s overrated. Maybe it’s even detrimental to actually living a productive and healthy live. You see, evolutionary <strong>humans weren’t designed to be happy all the time</strong>. For example, you’re having a great day, maybe you made progress on a project, then you have think what would make you happy and boom—the mood goes down if you don’t get&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Happiness is simply not wired into our brains and nervous system by millions of years of evolution. <strong>Humans were designed to survive</strong>, and survival doesn’t mean happiness. Survival is at the bottom of the Maslow’s pyramid, and it’s what our oldest brain is doing perfectly. Why work hard trying to achieve something you’re doing&nbsp;sub-optimally?</p>
<p>Lower expectations bring more satisfaction, right? Once I realized that we weren’t born to be happy, I had an epiphany which liberated&nbsp;me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forget about this illusive happiness. In the never-ending pursuit of it, you’ll remain&nbsp;miserable.</li>
<li>Stop thinking that you’re supposed to be happy all the time. Banish the entitled to feel good or thoughts on how to achieve&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Just live in the moment, survive and be productive, instead of worrying about illusive&nbsp;feeling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stop pursuing happiness; search meaning in your life&nbsp;instead.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>You only live once, but not in the context of how most people think about this phrase such as: party, drink, reward or entertain yourself. In other words, they justify some epicurean&nbsp;activities.</p>
<p>On the contrary, I use <span class="caps">YOLO</span> when I’m deciding to take on new projects, work, or tasks. My mindset is to create as many useful things as possible. Time is the only finite resource that we, humans,&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>Don’t postpone any longer something you wanted to do yesterday or last year. Time will pass anyway… So don’t spend your time on frivolous activities. Make your time count big&nbsp;time.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Tech advice: if you need a simple website for your project, then use <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub pages</a>. It’s free and better than cheap $4.99/mo hosting, which can be easily hacked, is slow and requires you to use&nbsp;cPanel.</p>
<p>Here’s what you’ll need to get your website up and&nbsp;running:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create account on GitHub (do it&nbsp;once).</li>
<li>Create a new&nbsp;repository.</li>
<li>Send your developer a link to that repository, and a Twitter Bootstrap theme of your choice (Google it if you don’t know where to get a beatiful&nbsp;theme).</li>
<li>Point your <span class="caps">CNAME</span> records in Godaddy, or whatever you’re using, to GitHub IPs (192.30.252.153 and&nbsp;192.30.252.154).</li>
<li>Merge pull request from you developer on&nbsp;GitHub.com.</li>
<li>Boom! You’ve got your&nbsp;website.</li>
</ol>
<p>I use this technique for my 10+ websites, some of them quite&nbsp;fancy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rpjs.co">http://rpjs.co</a></li>
<li><a href="http://150x.co">http://150x.co</a></li>

</ul>
<p>There’s no need for WordPress or <span class="caps">PHP</span>. GitHub Pages is free and it is faster than&nbsp;BlueHost.</p>
<p>The site must be static only without any <span class="caps">PHP</span>, Node.js or any other server-side logic.

            <h2><a href="/blog/all-restaurants-are-bad/">All Restaurants Are Bad</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>We love to go out and treat ourselves to nice meals! But it’s unhealty, because almost all <span class="caps">US</span> restaurants are bad for you in <a href="http://azat.co/blog/fast-food-paleo-style">the long run</a>. Why? This is a common sense and it has to do with us when we favor cheaper&nbsp;places.</p>
<p>In order for restaurants to stay in business they need to generate profits and cut&nbsp;costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would a restaurant use more expensive extra virgin olive or coconut oil instead of cheap vegetable (mutant) oils like <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/dear-mark-canola-oil">Canola</a>?&nbsp;No.</li>
<li>Would they use more expensive wild caught fish (especially salmon in sushi places) instead of antibiotic-filled farm-raised one?&nbsp;No.</li>
<li>Would they use more expensive organic vegetables and fruits instead of conventional ones?&nbsp;No.</li>
<li>Would they use more expensive organic grass-fed meat and poultry instead of conventional grain-fed one?&nbsp;No.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, when we vote with our dollars, we shouldn’t just choose cheaper places. If we continue doing it, organic good food will never become mainstream and cheap. Same thing happened with high-speed airlines: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde">Concorde</a> became extinct because passengers preferred cheaper but slower flying&nbsp;options.</p>
<p>What if it’s too expensive to eat at a good place like <a href="http://laughingplanetcafe.com">Laughing Planet</a>? Just cook at home!&nbsp;:-)</p>

<li>I don’t crave sugary&nbsp;treats</li>
<li><strong>I don’t get cold or flu</strong> as often (this year I took zero sick&nbsp;days!)</li>
<li>I have more&nbsp;energy</li>
<li>I can skip meals (when I travel or for fasting) and don’t feel bad, exhausted or&nbsp;anxious</li>
<li>I spend less time shopping because a lot of food options eliminated (cereals, breads, cakes,&nbsp;etc.)</li>

Personally, I find most fast food restaurants convenient. They are quick, offer a good value and have  predictable&nbsp;quality.</p>

<p>Here is what I&nbsp;order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salad with proteins (chicken or beef) and without&nbsp;croutons/bread/corn/grains</li>
<li>Burgers without buns, some places call them “wrapped in&nbsp;lettuces”</li>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with treating yourself once in a while to a small side of french fries (with garlic, yum!) or a smoothie/milk shake. Even Mark Sisson says that we should’t be hard on ourselves all the time (<a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/8020-principle/">80/20 rule</a>). Just be careful not to make it a daily (or for some even a weekly trip can be dangerous)&nbsp;meal!</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/the-crimean-war/">The Crimean War</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>In lieu of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2014/ukraine/">events</a> that started in December 2013 and still are happening in Ukraine (originally part of the Russian Empire and then the <span class="caps">USSR</span>), events that resulted in Crimea becoming a part of Russian Federation, I picked up a book about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War">Crimean War</a> of 1853-56. The book turned out to be a longer than I expected, about 600 pages, but I enjoyed every single page of it because the author gives such a good geopolitical picture of what was going on before and after the war, as well as the atmosphere and trends of the major part of the 19<span class="ord">th</span> century. The book is called <strong>The Crimean War: A History by Orlando Figes</strong> and it’s available in <a href="http://amzn.to/1krSGWg">Kindle on Amazon.com</a>.</p>
<p>I vaguely remember the very brief coverage of the Crimean War during my high school history class: something about the heroism of soldiers and Russian backwards technologies. It was good to look at the events from the British author’s point of view. Here are the things the surprised and impressed me the&nbsp;most:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Crimean War was the first modern war which involved heavy industrialized manufacturing — at least on the side of France and the British Empire — and the attrition warfare closely resembled World War&nbsp;I.</li>
<li>The public opinion was the major factor influencing French, British and Russian rulers in entering and ending the conflict — just like&nbsp;now!</li>
<li>The war started for many geopolitical (weakening of the Ottoman Empire), populist (the British press was very anti-Russian) and personal agendas (Nicholas I believed in the holy mission and the third Rome idea, and Napoleon <span class="caps">III</span> needed a victory to increase his&nbsp;influence).</li>
<li>Nobody liked the poor Turks, not even their French and British&nbsp;allies.</li>
<li>There were highly effective and flamboyant French <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouave">Zouave troops</a> after which the American Civil War Zouaves were modeled just a few years&nbsp;later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly enough, not many things have changed over 160 years in terms of the influence of public opinion and attempts at controlling it. Back then, the British Empire had <em>free</em> press, but there was some censorship of photography and in the army, e.g., the officers writing about the horrors of the first winter were considered traitors by their commanders. Orlando writes that the French emperor Napoleon <span class="caps">III</span> had spies everywhere and a tight grip on the press with censorship. The same things were true for the Russian Tsar Nicholas&nbsp;I.</p>
<p>One thing that changed dramatically was the speed of communication. The news traveled very slowly during the Crimean War — it took a few days in the beginning of the conflict for the news to reach its destination until the telegraph line was laid under the Black Sea (for the allies). Now, we can just sit in the comfort of our homes, scanning Twitter with the #Ukraine hashtag, and getting real-time updates, photos and even live streams of events miles&nbsp;away!</p>
<p><span class="caps">PS</span>: Twitter stops indexing search results after a couple of days, so you might want to try Storify for historical searches, e.g., <a href="https://storify.com/search?q=ukraine">https://storify.com/search?q=ukraine</a>.</p>
