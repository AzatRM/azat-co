          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/paleofx-2016/panel.jpg" alt="PaleoFX 2016 Panel: Paleo is growing bigger and business helps it"></p>
<p>I wrote before about how <a href="http://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers">being on a paleo lifestyle is like having superpowers</a>. Last week, I was lucky to attend PaleoFX, the biggest Paleo conference. It was kind of surreal to be around thousands of like-minded people, to see in-person almost all famous New York Times #1 Best-Sellers paleolebrities, and to be surrounded with all kinds of safe paleo-friendly food&amp;drinks. Here are some of the&nbsp;highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paleo business is growing: There were all kind of paleo flours, sweets, bars, powders, broths, fats and coffee infused with just about anything (butter, coconut, even&nbsp;mushrooms!).</li>
<li>Paleolebrities are regular people: most of them hang out at the expo or after giving their presentations to answer questions. I took a picture with Robb Wolf with who’s <a href="http://amzn.to/1t8KS6J">book</a> my paleo journey started 6 years&nbsp;ago.</li>
<li>There were insane number of healthy and fit looking people doing workout workshops (inspiring) as well as <em>average</em> looking people (making it less&nbsp;intimidating).</li>
<li>Bone broth is liquid gold: I knew that broth is healing but after listening to <a href="http://amzn.to/1VDS2dY">Dr. Kellyann</a> I decided to become disciplined about drinking 2 cups of bone broth. Her protocol is bone broth for 21 days and fast 1-2 days per&nbsp;week.</li>
<li><a href="https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/paleo16">Ben Greenfield’s presentation</a> was full of bio hacks to increase cognitive performance like jaw realignment, morning brain flush, infra-red saunas, yoga, low intensity <span class="caps">PEMF</span> and&nbsp;others.</li>
<li>Our gut bacteria has more <span class="caps">DNA</span> material than we: <a href="http://amzn.to/1VDS2uC">Dr. Perlmutter</a> gave a great presentation reinforcing the importance of our gut biome. One of the analogies stuck with me: we uploaded our <span class="caps">DNA</span>/genes to the cloud which is our gut&nbsp;bacteria.</li>
<li>Lack of sleep is aging and killing you faster: Just one night of sleep deprivation increases aging 10-15 years (temporarily) and decreases cognitive&nbsp;functions.</li>
<li>It’s harder to legally sell raw milk than marijuana (in some&nbsp;cases).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BF_4shkiXN9/?taken-by=azat_co">A lot of science is not reliable</a>, because studies to replicate findings and peer reviews are&nbsp;disincentivized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it was a great event to reinforce familiar, and learn new things about paleo lifestyle. I also got a lot of contacts for paleo-friendly web stores, products and services which will make my life on the paleo lifestyle even easier than&nbsp;before!</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/fisherman-and-businessman/">The Fisherman and the Businessman B.S.</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/fisherman-and-businessman/fish.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Have you heard the preamble about <a href="http://paulocoelhoblog.com/2015/09/04/the-fisherman-and-the-businessman">the fisherman and the businessman</a>? It’s often told in a feel-good blogs and talks. The fisherman’s nationality varies from Brazilian to Mexican, but the gist is that you don’t have to strive for success and achievement. If all you want to do if is to fish and go home early, then you can start doing it now (fisherman). In other words, if your goal is to relax after you’ve made money (businessman), then why not skip making money part and relax now&nbsp;?</p>
<p>I think it’s utterly <strong>bullshit</strong>—and potentially dangerous for those who take its advice seriously—for three reasons. The first is simple: the story don’t take into consideration <em>risks</em>. Let’s say your family member gets sick. If you have the money, you can send him/her to a good hospital. This is not an option for a poor&nbsp;fisherman. </p>
<p>Another reason is the experience, adventure, the thrill and <em>satisfaction</em> of making money, doing well in your craft (fishing and business management), career or business. This is the reward in itself for most people in the world of business. Think of it as the journey which will make you a better person. If all you do is fish, go home early and relax, then you are not challenging yourself enough. You’re not growing in your craft or&nbsp;skills.</p>
<p>The last reason is that if you just fish for your family, then you deprive other of the fruits of your labor. If you’re any good (and with practice and time you should become good at pretty much any trade), then you’ll be depriving others, e.g., people in a seafood market, of your fish. So staying at your current level and not taking it bigger is stealing from society. <strong>It’s selfish</strong>.</p>
<p>Don’t believe all the stupid stories you read or hear from the so called gurus of life. Think for&nbsp;yourself!</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/success-is-boring/">Success is Boring</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/success-is-boring/success-is-boring.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Success is what we crave. Parents, peers and culture pushes success down our throats as it’s the best thing ever. Yet not many people claim success in their lives. They jump from one hot opportunity to&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>One day they are building SaaS, the next month consulting, and then selling cheap privately labeled and growth-hacked shit on Amazon.com. It’s like an addiction. Starting a business is easy. Starting micro businesses like SaaS, info product or private label is extremely easier than managing brick and mortar. <em>Entrepreneur become parallel entrepreneur.</em> They juggle multiple things. Each is moderately successful, but nothing great… why? Because success is&nbsp;boring.</p>
<p><strong>Some people like the thrill more than success.</strong> Like many thrill seekers they deny this fact. They sabotage their success. They are like gamblers who hit the slot machines and frustrated by the interrupted flow of their trance when they actually do win. The adrenaline junkies, those people love to start new venture and see them succeed from 0 to 60, but they never stay long enough to see any really great&nbsp;fruits.</p>
<p>Some people like the inviting adventure of new projects more than the steady long-term progress of establishing ones. If you need serendipity go pick up a new sport (surfing, rock climbing, Krav Maga) or learn how to ride a motorcycle, but don’t bet your career on a risky&nbsp;proposition.</p>
<p>I wrote this post mostly for myself to stay focused and as a reminder that <strong>real success is boring</strong>. Find the thing you’re great at and which is in demand and valued by others. Then, you stick with it unless you fully get its potential. It might be 5, 10 or 15 years. Give it a time. Everything great takes time. Otherwise we won’t treasure it that much. Boring is good.  You have my permission to be boring… and achieve the success you want be it personal life, health or&nbsp;business.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/happiness/">Pursuit of Happiness as The Major Source of Unhappiness or Why Happiness is Overrated</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/happiness/cactus.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The more I think about happiness, the more I come to the conclusion that it’s overrated. Maybe it’s even detrimental to actually living a productive and healthy live. You see, evolutionary <strong>humans weren’t designed to be happy all the time</strong>. For example, you’re having a great day, maybe you made progress on a project, then you have think what would make you happy and boom—the mood goes down if you don’t get&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Happiness is simply not wired into our brains and nervous system by millions of years of evolution. <strong>Humans were designed to survive</strong>, and survival doesn’t mean happiness. Survival is at the bottom of the Maslow’s pyramid, and it’s what our oldest brain is doing perfectly. Why work hard trying to achieve something you’re doing&nbsp;sub-optimally?</p>
<p>Lower expectations bring more satisfaction, right? Once I realized that we weren’t born to be happy, I had an epiphany which liberated&nbsp;me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forget about this illusive happiness. In the never-ending pursuit of it, you’ll remain&nbsp;miserable.</li>
<li>Stop thinking that you’re supposed to be happy all the time. Banish the entitled to feel good or thoughts on how to achieve&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Just live in the moment, survive and be productive, instead of worrying about illusive&nbsp;feeling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stop pursuing happiness; search meaning in your life&nbsp;instead.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Tech advice: if you need a simple website for your project, then use <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub pages</a>. It’s free and better than cheap $4.99/mo hosting, which can be easily hacked, is slow and requires you to use&nbsp;cPanel.</p>
<p>Here’s what you’ll need to get your website up and&nbsp;running:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create account on GitHub (do it&nbsp;once).</li>
<li>Create a new&nbsp;repository.</li>
<li>Send your developer a link to that repository, and a Twitter Bootstrap theme of your choice (Google it if you don’t know where to get a beatiful&nbsp;theme).</li>
<li>Point your <span class="caps">CNAME</span> records in Godaddy, or whatever you’re using, to GitHub IPs (192.30.252.153 and&nbsp;192.30.252.154).</li>
<li>Merge pull request from you developer on&nbsp;GitHub.com.</li>
<li>Boom! You’ve got your&nbsp;website.</li>
</ol>
<p>I use this technique for my 10+ websites, some of them quite&nbsp;fancy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rpjs.co">http://rpjs.co</a></li>
<li><a href="http://150x.co">http://150x.co</a></li>

<li><a href="http://nodeprogram.com">http://nodeprogram.com</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There’s no need for WordPress or <span class="caps">PHP</span>. GitHub Pages is free and it is faster than&nbsp;BlueHost.</p>
<p>The site must be static only without any <span class="caps">PHP</span>, Node.js or any other server-side logic. You can use <a href="http://www.foxyform.com">foxyform</a> or <a href="http://www.emailmeform.com">EmailMeForm</a> for contact forms, and <a href="http://gumroad.com">Gumroad</a> for sales.

            <h2><a href="/blog/all-restaurants-are-bad/">All Restaurants Are Bad</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>We love to go out and treat ourselves to nice meals! But it’s unhealty, because almost all <span class="caps">US</span> restaurants are bad for you in <a href="http://azat.co/blog/fast-food-paleo-style">the long run</a>. Why? This is a common sense and it has to do with us when we favor cheaper&nbsp;places.</p>
<p>In order for restaurants to stay in business they need to generate profits and cut&nbsp;costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would a restaurant use more expensive extra virgin olive or coconut oil instead of cheap vegetable (mutant) oils like <a href="http://www.marksdailyapple.com/dear-mark-canola-oil">Canola</a>?&nbsp;No.</li>
<li>Would they use more expensive wild caught fish (especially salmon in sushi places) instead of antibiotic-filled farm-raised one?&nbsp;No.</li>
<li>Would they use more expensive organic vegetables and fruits instead of conventional ones?&nbsp;No.</li>
<li>Would they use more expensive organic grass-fed meat and poultry instead of conventional grain-fed one?&nbsp;No.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, when we vote with our dollars, we shouldn’t just choose cheaper places. If we continue doing it, organic good food will never become mainstream and cheap. Same thing happened with high-speed airlines: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde">Concorde</a> became extinct because passengers preferred cheaper but slower flying&nbsp;options.</p>
<p>What if it’s too expensive to eat at a good place like <a href="http://laughingplanetcafe.com">Laughing Planet</a>? Just cook at home!&nbsp;:-)</p>
