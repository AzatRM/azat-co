            <h2><a href="/blog/work-rest/">Work and Rest</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Working is important. It not only provides material means, social status and pride in a well work done, but also meaning and motivation which in tern extend a person‚Äôs life. According to <a href="http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2016/03/21/jech-2015-207097.short">some studies</a>, people who retire and don‚Äôt find another activity, die fast. Or that tech millionaires are unhappy once they are let go or fire, or that lottery winners are miss the&nbsp;working. </p>
<p>However, resting is important too and helps to avoid burn-out and all kids of nasty nervous diseases which tend to decrease one‚Äôs life. Working productively while having rest once in a while is the best approach. üë®‚ÄçüíªüîÑüõå  <strong>What‚Äôs crazy is that many people do things which they think is resting but in fact they are draining their energy even more.</strong> Here are some of these things. Some of them might shock&nbsp;you!</p>
<ul>
<li>Going out on the weekend: Breaking your sleep cycle with loud noise, excessive drinking or eating - not&nbsp;good.</li>
<li>Traveling, especially stressful traveling: Being in a nice place taken care of by the hotel staff and restaurants is nice but the traveling itself is almost always a stress (airport, planes, traffic). Trying new food and changing time zones are bad stressors&nbsp;to. </li>
<li>Watching sports, <span class="caps">TV</span> shows or news: they all drain your energy because your body is passive yet emotions and adrenaline glands are&nbsp;not.</li>
<li>Being on social media: More people feel depressed after using social media due to ‚Äúsuccess theatre‚Äù and the addiction mechanism of&nbsp;novelty.</li>
<li>Multitasking: Not being in the present and flow state, e.g., when you at your kids soccer game, don‚Äôt text with work. That‚Äôs a disservice to you, work and your family. Be present whatever you do. Put your phone on an airplane mode. Most likely you are not a firefighter or a brain surgeon. You work can wait until the weekend is&nbsp;over.</li>
<li>Not sleeping enough or waking up on the weekend at different&nbsp;hours.</li>
<li>Eating refined carbs (pizza, pasta, juices, smoothies): Sugar is easily digestible form spike insulin and very toxic for your&nbsp;body.</li>
<li>Not getting resistance training and doing too much chronic cardio: Chronic cardio is a huge stressor, tough on joints and ages people&nbsp;fast.</li>
<li>Smoking weed: If smoking tobacco causes cancer due to the burned stuff that people inhale, then why burning weed and smoking it <em>wouldn‚Äôt</em> cause cancer&nbsp;too?</li>
<li>Hanging out with ‚Äúfriends‚Äù: Wrong type of friends can bring drama and having too much drama in your life is not good for mental&nbsp;health.</li>
<li>Postponing important things, i.e., procrastination: It might feel good short-term to postpone an important project or a decision but it‚Äôll snowball stress in the&nbsp;long-term.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are probably more things which are misleading to people. They mask as rest but actually suck up your energy. I would say not watching news or <span class="caps">TV</span> shows and having enough sleep are two most important which will give the majority the most bang for their buck. Focus on that if you feel&nbsp;tired!</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>This year I had a lot of changes. And I‚Äôll have more until the end of year! It started with a small one. I upgraded my laptop. The tool which I use 8-10 hours everyday. Then I changed the place of living‚Ä¶ and did other <em>really</em> big life changes. Small things lead to big changes. It‚Äôs a snowball. I remember something about cognitive dissonance. Probably that‚Äôs it. If you are decisive and not afraid of changes for good, then it translates to other areas of life and&nbsp;work‚Ä¶ </p>
<p>What‚Äôs funny is that every big change which I did was perceived as bigger before but in fact was 10x easier. The lesson: <strong>don‚Äôt think changing is hard</strong>. Stop your mind when it starts to envision any problems or hurdles  which might not even materialize. Of course, account for the worse scenario but don‚Äôt paralyze yourself with excessive analysis. <em>Avoid analysis paralysis by taking action even if it‚Äôs a small action at&nbsp;first.</em></p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>A lot of people think they lack motivation. They feel lazy. They listen to Gary Vaynerchuk or Tony Robinns. It might help for a while but why not solve the problem at the root cause? What these people really lack is a big enough ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. They become complacent because most of their needs are met. Simply take on more and larger responsibilities and you‚Äôll be motivated. Get new bigger problems to solve. Find a new job, get married, start a family, have kids, sign a book contract, start or buy a business. You‚Äôll see your motivation will skyrocket, and the complacency will&nbsp;decrease!</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/stress/">How to Live a Stress-Free Life</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>The title of this post is really a misnomer because a stress-free life is nothing good. Stress helps us grow and it‚Äôs usually a good thing when there‚Äôs enough time to recover, recuperate and heal. Think going to a gym. You exercise, which is a form of stress, but after a recovery period you become stronger. Humans evolutionary evolved to thrive under this type of acute stress followed by recovery (catabolic and anabolic&nbsp;processes).</p>
<p>However there‚Äôs another type of stress which is called prolonged or chronic stress. This type of stress is detrimental because it does <span class="caps">NOT</span> allow for a recovery period. For example, thinking about an up-coming test for your final exam, a job interview or not being able to pay your mortgage because you got&nbsp;fire. </p>
<p>The best way to avoid this bad chronic stress is just to avoid thinking about it. Most problems are not even real. They are products of our imagination. The longer you procrastinate and overanalyze, the worse the overwhelm, fear and stress&nbsp;become. </p>
<p>What makes it worse is that our brains can‚Äôt handle more than 4-5 items in our conscious minds. When you day dream or analyze in your mind (like in a shower or before going to bed), most likely later you‚Äôll forget whatever the ideas, steps or details you thought about. This will add to&nbsp;stress. </p>
<p>Have a dedicated time to think. Mark it in your calendar. Write the steps, details and questions in a notebook or in an application. Looking at a todo list or a high-level outline will bring you calmness and&nbsp;clarity.</p>
<p>In addition, you can take action which will clear and dispel the fears and imagined problems. All you need to complete a big task is just to know what are the next actionable steps, and take&nbsp;them. </p>
<p>One of the best way to deal with procrastination is to tell yourself that you‚Äôll just start on a task or see how to write the first page (for a book) or create the first file (for a program). The mind will want to continue by inertia once you get into the flow and pick up momentum by seeing results.  So you can trick it by just&nbsp;starting. </p>
<p>Pomodoro technique uses 25 minute chunks to trick the brain into starting by limiting to ‚Äúexposure‚Äù to a task to 25 minutes which will typically turn into another 25 minutes and then to another 25 minutes until you get to some milestone on a&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>The last tip, don‚Äôt load your mind with tasks or problems unless you can either solve them right away or make a note to work on them later. Doing so will occupy your mind but you can‚Äôt accomplish the task right away. Remember, your brain can hold only several items in the conscious mind at the same&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>For example, don‚Äôt check your email on your phone in a metro, because there would be emails which will require you to use a computer.  It‚Äôs easier to read an email and do the task right away, than to read it, mark as ‚Äútodo later‚Äù or unread, then come back to it, read again and do the&nbsp;task.</p>
<p>To sum up, avoid chronic stress by taking action and avoiding over thinking especially thinking without taking notes. Planning and taking action beat any overwhelm and procrastination. At the same time, indulge in acute stress once in a while to continue to&nbsp;grow. </p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Needless to say that cafes, <a href="http://azat.co/blog/open-offices">open offices</a>, commute and slow internet all impede productivity. To increase efficiency, distraction-free <a href="http://azat.co/blog/flow">flow</a> and productivity, I stayed home for a few days over the weekend to work on a&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>I finished the project and made some money all digitally and remotely via the Internet and phone. I ordered food (groceries) using food delivery services. I worked out in a gym in my building and got fresh air on my&nbsp;patio.</p>
<p>The result was an weird feeling that I don‚Äôt need to leave my home at all. It‚Äôs almost magical to realize the digital inflow of money (salary and book royalties) and digital outflow (to pay for food). Also, I was healthier because I cooked at home instead of eating out, and I didn‚Äôt listen to gossips or read/watch news even in passing on a gym‚Äôs <span class="caps">TV</span> or in&nbsp;metro.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs fascinating that all can be done digitally witout leaving one‚Äôs home and it‚Äôs peculiar how little humans needs sometimes for productive, satisfactory and healthy&nbsp;live.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/delegation/">The Right and Wrong Ways to Delegate</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>My main jobs are software engineering and writing. They are crafts and as with many crafts they are harder to delegate. Think mass produced car vs. designing a car and the factory to mass produce it. Software and books are scalable because they can be replicated infinitely without any loss, but the actual act of writing them is a creative hard-to-scale&nbsp;process. </p>
<p>Over the years of writing software and books, I‚Äôve been learning to identify and delegate some repeatable tasks. I learned that the right way to delegate is to find a repeatable task which you know a) cannot be easily automated b) needs to be performed 100+ times or 2+ hours, and c) straightforward to document and&nbsp;explain. </p>
<p>There‚Äôs a cost of review. Do not skip reviewing the end work and either fixing mistakes yourself or sending it back for a re-work (in this case always review again). Reviewing helps not only to make a better product but it‚Äôll give you the confidence in your product and your team (or not but then you at least know and can fix issue&nbsp;later).</p>
<p>Some leader say, never delegate things you are not willing to do yourself. It‚Äôs <span class="caps">B.S.</span> Everything is situational. I delegated things I dreaded doing and they got done. If I didn‚Äôt delegate them, they could have taken longer (procrastination) or would have never materialized at all. Done is better than perfect in this case. However, running at least the first 3-4 times through the routine will help you greatly in writing instructions and standard operation procedures&nbsp;(SOPs). </p>
<p>Do not delegate to perform things which do not make sense financially and don‚Äôt be cheap on things which will generate&nbsp;revenue. </p>
<p>Delegate at things you think you are okay or good (even worse), but in reality you suck at. For example, a lot of programmers think they are good at design and their confidence leads to terrible websites, book covers and software which prevents them from making more&nbsp;sales. </p>
<p>To summarize this post,&nbsp;do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delegate to get better supplemental skill to your own and don‚Äôt be cheap,&nbsp;e.g.,design</li>
<li>Change process to eliminate or automate, e.g., create a self-service instead of customer support or use <span class="caps">AWS</span> RDS instead of maintaining a&nbsp;database</li>
<li>Delegate repeatable tasks by having detailed easy to follow&nbsp;instructions</li>
<li>Always review before the final&nbsp;step</li>
<li>Delegate scary for you tasks but only after you‚Äôve done them a few times and they‚Äôve stopped being&nbsp;scary</li>
<li>Constantly re-evaluate, i.e., look for opportunities to change to a cheaper provider or simplify the&nbsp;process</li>
<li>Delegate to get a second opinion, e.g., tech review, copy&nbsp;editing</li>
</ul>
<p>Example of things you <em>probably</em> shouldn‚Äôt be doing&nbsp;yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design (for programmers or&nbsp;writers)</li>
<li>Scheduling appointments by&nbsp;phone</li>
<li>Fixing formatting, links, code, fonts, etc. in <span class="caps">MS</span> Word, Markdown, and other&nbsp;formats</li>
<li>First pass at creating captions and&nbsp;transcriptons</li>
<li>First pass at video&nbsp;editing</li>
<li>Spinning up and maintaining your own database instead of using&nbsp;BaaS</li>
<li>Spinning up and maintaining your own servers (virtual machines) instead of using&nbsp;PaaS</li>
<li>Importing, exporting, enrolling instead of&nbsp;automating</li>
<li>Submitting to any forms: job boards, conferences (request for proposals), clients,&nbsp;etc.</li>
<li>Posting to social&nbsp;media</li>
<li>Deploying code instead of having&nbsp;<span class="caps">CD</span></li>
<li>Testing code instead of having&nbsp;<span class="caps">CI</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Do not delegate (or automate) things when one or more&nbsp;applies:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will  faster for you to do it and it‚Äôs not a repeatable task then to train and review (review can take a long&nbsp;time)</li>
<li>It‚Äôs a last step&nbsp;review</li>
<li>It‚Äôs hard to describe (means&nbsp;creative) </li>
<li>It‚Äôs a core function for&nbsp;you </li>
<li>It requires extremely high standards which will cost you too much or hard to find people to&nbsp;do</li>
<li>It‚Äôs&nbsp;marketing/sales</li>
</ul>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>As I was reviewing transcripts for one of my Node University courses, I was surprised to see so many ‚Äúso‚Äù, ‚Äúum‚Äù, and ‚Äúah‚Äù filler words. It was a very painful experience to realize that your speech is far from perfect. Of course, with training most people can improve their speech: avoid filler words, accents and improve intonation. This is what professional voice actors, news anchors and movie stars did. And they are in high demand and&nbsp;popular! </p>
<p>Think of it, a lot of improvements to the unconscious actions such as speech, language, writing, personal finance (it‚Äôs defined by habits not logic), eating and fitness are the <strong>hardest</strong>, but they bring the most rewards once you make the changes. Unconscious changes are the hardest, but at the same time they are the <em>easiest</em> to maintain once acquired. The reason is that there‚Äôs an autopilot effect. The reward part comes from the fact that there are fewer people who can change those unconscious things in or around&nbsp;them. </p>
<p>For example, if you train yourself to speak well, you can become a Pluralsight course author or a paid public speaker. If you invest time and effort in Spanish, you can speak it without translating from English to Spanish. Not many people can do either of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Unconscious autopilots are great, but tweaking them takes time and efforts. Ego is crushed which makes for less competition. <em>There are no traffic jams on the extra mile</em>. The good thing is that once you applied the change, everything can go back to the autopilot: now you <a href="http://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers">eat healthy</a> without thinking about it, <a href="http://azat.co/blog/flow">focus quicker</a> and read more of good <a href="http://azat.co/blog/200-books">books</a>. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs funny how things work but knowing that there‚Äôs a big reward ahead if you can tweak a bad unconscious habit into a good one creates a good&nbsp;motivation.</p>

First, the parallels between risk, casino, gambling and the stock market. Second, the fact that the author was innovating and constantly moving forward into areas which are still not saturated and still unproved away from techniques and areas which became more competitive and mainstream. Natural curiosity and data-driven non-emotional approach helped the author a lot! These are my notes about the book which I highly recommend reading, so if next time someone tells you that the casino always wins, your can refer them to this book which proved&nbsp;otherwise.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/time-tips/">10 Easy Tips to Create More Time in Your Life</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Being busy has became a badge of honor. For me, it‚Äôs just plain stupid. I do a lot of things but I‚Äôm not busy. In fact, one of the questions people ask me a lot is ‚ÄúHow do you find&nbsp;time?‚Äù</p>
<p>First of all, you cannot find it. It‚Äôs not a pair of sun glasses which you left at a beach. You can‚Äôt find time or lose it‚Ä¶ but you can spend it on stupid things or lasting valuable good&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>Let me give some examples of stupid thing that I <em>generally</em> avoid doing and some time&nbsp;tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>Avoid texting with friends - just freaking call or talk in person when you want talk, and use text is only for scheduling&nbsp;hangouts</li>
<li>Use activities which do not require focus like folding laundry, washing dishes or writing <span class="caps">HTML</span> to listen to audio books and good podcasts. That‚Äôs how I was able to <a href="http://azat.co/blog/200-books">consume over 200 books in the last three years</a>.</li>
<li>Avoid reading Facebook timeline or looking at Instagram news feed. Only post, don‚Äôt&nbsp;consume.</li>
<li>Avoid checking Twitter feed and when you do only subscribe to a handful of people, no more than 200 people and look into ‚ÄúIn case you missed&nbsp;it‚Äù</li>
<li>Watch movie traiglers instead of full movies. I only watch movies trailers in planes that‚Äôs enough to see all the good scenes and in 80% of the cases understand the plot‚Ä¶ but even that makes me want to puke either because modern movies are so brain-dead or full of loser-oriented propaganda (e.g.,&nbsp;Hangover)</li>
<li>Pretend <span class="caps">TV</span> and cable do not exist and skip commercials by getting Netflix or Amazon Prime if you want some dumb&nbsp;entertainment</li>
<li>Ignore surveys or providing feedback beyond stars or thumbs on hotels, flights, books, apps,&nbsp;services</li>
<li>Avoid writing reviews unless I really want for my own notes/thinking as I did with <a href="https://webapplog.com/managing-humans-summary/">Managing Humans</a> or <a href="http://azat.co/blog/barbell">Antifragile</a></li>
<li>Avoid being tired because when you are tired you want to take a break, a long weekend or a vacation. Don‚Äôt get tired in the first place! To do so, <a href="http://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers">eat property</a>, exercise and have a good sleep <em>every night</em>.</li>
<li>Avoid reading popular magazines, Medium, blog posts, news‚Äî<a href="http://azat.co/blog/ignorance">ignorance is a bliss</a> in these&nbsp;cases</li>
</ol>
<p>Don‚Äôt confuse activity with results. Being busy is not equates with achieving a lot. Observe what things are wasteful and not productive. Just the act of observing will help you to gain more time to be more productive while spending less time and being less busy and&nbsp;tired!</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/success-formula/">Success Formula</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Before I wrote that <a href="http://azat.co/blog/success-is-boring">success is boring</a>. It still sounds true to me now, but I noticed a simple yet powerful formula for success. It works in almost all cases as far as I know based on dozens of biographies and autobiographies I‚Äôve read and&nbsp;heard.</p>
<p><strong>Success is talent plus hard work plus&nbsp;luck.</strong></p>
<p>Talent is about up-brining and genes. It‚Äôs related to luck but the luck formula component itself is more about present and future than predetermined past of early childhood, country of origin, language or&nbsp;culture.</p>
<p>The luck in the formula could be generated by more hard work (more activity leads to more opportunity), but it‚Äôs not a guaranteed linear relationship because statistically numbers could be low for the cause and effect to play&nbsp;out.</p>
<p>Hard work is self explanatory. More talent can require less hard work and vice versa if you are less talented you could compensate to a certain degree with hard&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>So three components are related and might affect one another but as a general direction this formula clear and universal. It makes going for success in any area&nbsp;straightforward.</p>
