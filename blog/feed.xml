      <title>How to Fight Perfectionism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of us &lt;em&gt;intuitively&lt;/em&gt; understand that better products and services is better for you as an employee or business owner. They can attract more customers and propel you to success, whatever that is for you. Some of us know the inspiring stories of obsessed entrepreneurs who drove the product to perfection amidst delays and budget overruns (e.g., Steve Jobs). Common sense tells us that the less flaws there is, the better. It could be due to our experience as a consumer of goods. It could be because we learned it in schools where we avoided errors in our homework and tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, things are not as easy in life and business as in school. On the other side of the spectrum is the analysis paralysis and procrastination, never published manuscripts and never deployed code. &lt;em&gt;Sometimes it pays off to do half-baked experiments and fail once in a while&lt;/em&gt;. There’s a whole methodology around it called Lean Startups. Unfortunately, almost none of us hear about myriads of other entrepreneurs who didn’t make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s time to polish and improve, and there’s time to call it’s done even when it’s not perfect.&lt;/em&gt; After all, &lt;strong&gt;done is better than perfect undone&lt;/strong&gt;. Here’s a quick list of things you can do to fight perfectionism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take more projects: This will force you to finish the current projects faster. Commit and then decide how to deliver!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set deadlines and share them with &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; people like clients, bosses, co-workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t sleep enough for three nights or work at nights: I noticed that my perfectionism goes down when I am tired and just want to finish a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outsource: Hiring is like buying time. It’s like cheat codes in video games only it’s better for everyone (you, your client and the person you are hiring)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember your WHYs: Why are you doing this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide products and features into two categories: incremental improvement (perfectionism is the key) and ground-breaking (first-to-release is the key).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a better widget is fulfilling which in turn is important. But when you do so beyond a reason, ask yourself a question: Am I afraid of success? Is this a self-sabotage? Procrastination? If yes, then kill the perfectionism excuse and finish the project. In this case, perfection is a burden and an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ego is the Friend: Review on Ego Is the Enemy</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/ego-is-the-friend/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2016 13:30:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent Ryan’s book is another popular junk-read which have 0 substance and not only waste time but actually distract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the title of another popular junk-read &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2ecGUmr&quot;&gt;Ego Is the Enemy&lt;/a&gt;, I should say that ego is the friend if you want to change or achieve anything in life. Every time you think I’m a good software developer you will have to back it up with action. If you decide to lose weight, it’s far more useful to say to yourself “every day in every way, I’m getting leaner and healthier” than to stick to your old ego of a person who has bad genes, heavy bones or stress full life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples in the book are terrible. They are not accurate and distorted to support the author’s point of view. His choice to consider two Union generals and 0 Confederate generals while most historians agree that Confederates had better generals is biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, the author never proves that ego is bad or is the enemy. He tell anecdotes without any studies. Why a person became successful? It could be because he identified himself with success and had big ego. Yes, maybe he failed later because he stopped delivering great results but that doesn’t support the hypothesis that ego is bad. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation&quot;&gt;Correlation does not equal causation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: avoid this book.. and maybe this &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2evHobx&quot;&gt;one as well&lt;/a&gt; and all other Tim Ferriss related junk-reads.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bad Long Weekends: 6-Day Workweek Manifesto</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/weekends/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2016 03:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/weekends/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/1*Tdu6SILy42fjbx5pO3YgVw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Weekend Office&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekends are too long… waaaay too loooong. Two full days! We should switch to 6-day workweeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think I’m crazy, because recently some companies started to experiment with &lt;em&gt;4-day workweeks instead of normal 5&lt;/em&gt;, not 6. Even some countries toyed with the idea to make it a law. Also, books like 4-hour Workweek became the best seller because people want to work less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah, yeah. Believe me. I thought it all through. People need to work more, not less to achieve satisfaction. We need more workdays. Here are my reasons to work 6 days (if not for the entire country then just for you):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same total number of hours: People can spend in deep work only up to 4 hours per day. So leave earlier than typical 5pm during the week, hit the gym, and come to work on Saturday. And according to studies, people on average actually work only 4 hours anyway. The rest is Facebook, chatting with co-workers and breaks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased productivity: Open office is a detriment to productivity. You are less distracted on Saturdays so you can get more done. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased income: If you don’t work then you are more likely to spend money on “relaxing” or entertainment such as eating out, trips, shopping, etc. This is a double whammy because you are not just spending more but you are earning less. For example, your weekend getaway didn’t cost $400 for hotel and $200 for food, but $1,400 ($600 PLUS $800 which you could have made during the leisure time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased satisfaction: You can get ahead on your projects faster be it for work or side gigs. It will create momentum, motivation and move you ahead even faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased learning: After two days of not working on a thing I often forget what I needed to do. Loss of context is waste. By working on a project everyday I can stay focused. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bible says so: Even if you are not a religious person, you can learn a thing or two from a 2000-year best seller which says to rest only ONE day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Litmus test for a job change: If you can’t make yourself think of working on your primary job for one extra day per week. If just think about it makes you wanna puke back your organic smoothie, then maybe it’s time to find yourself a better one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working 6 days per week on either my main full time job, side-projects or taking classes for more than a decade. I feel weird if I have to take two days off in a week. There’s nothing to do by the second day. All the rest is done. All the errands are done. You start coming up with stupid activities like “Oh, let’s go to the beach!” or “I should buy a motorcycle!”… which most of the time only make you exhausted by Monday instead of helping you to recharge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researched proved that human brains relax when they switch tasks not when they have nothing to do. Replenish your energy by switching tasks and picking a creative side-project in which you have a lot of control like building your own app or contributing to open source. My thing is writing books and recording video courses. Also, Saturdays are great for reading, learning, thinking, reflecting, goal setting and budgeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many benefits, working 6 days per week is a non-brainer. Be smart and work hard at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Email Filter</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/email-filter/</link>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/email-filter/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2cbhiJv&quot;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt;, I was sold on removing distractions. One of the concept is to have an email filter. Not an automatic one but some set of criteria which will force the sender to think and put more work into their emails. Here’s what I came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filters which your email must adhere to increase chances of my reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No questions which you can find on Google/Bing/GoGoDuck under 10 min. If you still have a question, post it in a public forum and include a link so others can benefit from the answer too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No offers for phone calls, just be friends, or &lt;strong&gt;coffee meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an interesting offer for me to collaborate, do business or work on a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No promotion of your company, product or service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have precise amount of time required from me and the list of benefits for me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have fewer than 3 paragraphs and preferable a one-sentence TL;DR with one actionable step at the bottom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meeting criteria won’t guarantee a reply. Not meeting criteria will guarantee a delete or a blocking. :) And yes, don’t think that if you send me an email (or anyone), they are obligated to reply.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Don't Move to San Francisco or 7 Reasons Why You Should Avoid Living in the Bay Area</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/not-sf/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2016 15:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/not-sf/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/not-sf/I_hate_this_city____sanfrancisco__sanfran__sf__california.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;San Francisco, CA&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lived fro 5 years in the Bay Area which is San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, and everything in between them (a.k.a. Silicon Valley). Before that I lived in Washington DC for 6 year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t confuse tourism with immigration if you’ve been in the Bay Area on a brief vacation and liked it. Despite what you’ve seen in movies, San Francisco and Silicon Valley are terrible places to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously. Avoid moving to San Francisco and Silicon Valley because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will never be able to afford your own place&lt;/strong&gt;: Forget about owning your own house unless you’re super rich tech millionaire (which you won’t become); and large chunk of your pay check will go to the landlord because of the ridiculous laws prohibiting more housing and scaring off owners from renting out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will have to work insane hours&lt;/strong&gt; in an open-space office filled with extremely loud co-workers and stupid super noisy toys while being assaulted by dogs 🐕 and shot at with nerf guns… needless to say your productivity will be close to 0, and you’ll have to catch up after hours and come to work early. Startups had to use the open-office layout because they wanted to save money. Big companies blindly copied it without thinking to “foster” communication and create innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You won’t become a millionaire&lt;/strong&gt; creating a startup, because your startup will burn through VC money faster than in any other place: Raising money is easy, but spending it on expensive engineers and office is easier. If you manage to partner or hire someone, expect them to leave for greener pastures in 1 year max.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You be SINGLE and lack in true friendship&lt;/strong&gt;: Friendship and dating are not just hard, they are almost impossible, because you are surrounded with smart ambitious driven overachiever transplants who can’t find time to FaceTime let alone meet (because they are overworked due to poor office environment?); and if you’re already married holding on to your spouse will be hard (see 2 and 6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will get hot a lot&lt;/strong&gt;, because typically there is NO air conditioning in buildings. Yes. it’s 2016 and no A/Cs. ☀️ Also, the all-year-round climate with drought will bore and make you long for winter or rain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will feel inferior most of the times&lt;/strong&gt;: You always be surrounded with people smarter, luckier, more hard-working and more successful people than yourself: If you have a bit of an inferiority complex from time to time, here it will be multiplied by 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will start hating driving&lt;/strong&gt; because why bother? Streets of San Francisco, 101, I-80, Bay Bridge, any bridge… everything is backed up pretty much all the time. 🚦 Public transportation sucks. It’s filthy, slow and full of crazies. This leads to problem number 4 because keeping up with people will be harder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So give all these points, any reasonable human being who wants to remain sane and productive should avoid San Francisco and the Bay Area and live some where else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: This post has sarcasm, but also has some true points.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Text is Awesome 📝</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/text/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27  Aug 2016 11:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/text/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/text/harvard-coop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Harvard Coop&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite voice and video communication becoming cheap, ubiquitous and more popular (VoIP, Skype, FaceTime, WhatsApp, Viber, etc.), this increase create only more and more text communication. Text is so inferior in term of conveying emotions, intonation, and body language to video or even voice. Right? Then why don’t drop it or at least use less and call, FaceTime, Skype each other? Asynchronicity is one thing, but you can do voice and video asynchronously too, just record and send it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think text is awesome and will become even more popular exactly because of the thing than makes it terrible&lt;/strong&gt;, that’s desensitization—stripping emotions, body language, character, accent, mood, and other things humans grasp on conscious and subconscious levels. In other words, the same things which are beneficial for better understanding could also be distractions. What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate my point, when someone is reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://reactquickly.co&quot;&gt;a book on React&lt;/a&gt; they don’t want to be distracted away from an already comprehensive material. Also, text is more precise meaning if it says “221 Main St”, “createElement()” or “8pm” you know that for sure. More over, text is easier to go back to refer to than video or voice with their tiny imprecise sliders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, you can hide a bad mood, a dislike or a passive-aggressive behavior behind text. (I’m not saying that passive-aggressive behavior is good though.) Thus, text leaves more to imagination of a reader which makes the experience more customized and more personal. For example, I hated listening to a fake-accented &lt;em&gt;For Whom the Bell Tolls&lt;/em&gt;; I just despise when narrators think they must mimic all the accents and change pronunciation—just get out of the way a narrator, please get lost… become invisible. I don’t want anything between my experience and the book. Same things happen if I watch YouTube videos where I start noticing the quality, background, hair style, lighting and many other things which distract me from comprehending the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as messengers, I’ve noticed that when you just text with someone and never talk, you have a different mental image of that person. If you ever meet or talk with that person it can feel like being with a stranger. :) Or maybe a lot of people are self-conscious and camera-shy while others don’t like the sound of their own voice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as creation, an added benefit of writing is that it forces you to think better. You see, when I started writing this post, I had only an idea, but now there are a few a few arguments and a better formed opinion. You can go back edit, review and edit again while with voice and video you’d have to re-record the entire clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, text is not going away. In fact it’s becoming more popular way of communicating despite the fact that internet speed and data plans allow for video and voice messages. Knowing that, it’s crucial to be as effective as possible (and then some more) at your written communication: emails, social media, messengers, blogging, books, and reports. For these reasons, it’s true to say that &lt;strong&gt;writing is probably the most important skill in life and career&lt;/strong&gt;. Learn how to communicate better via text, practice and use text medium to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stop Reading Biographies</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/bios/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27  Aug 2016 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/bios/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished listening to another &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2b99qVA&quot;&gt;biography&lt;/a&gt;. It was one of those 30-hour monsters! A typical audio book is 6-8 hours. Why these authors think more is better. No, no and no. In most cases they are wrong, because they end up filling the pages with unnecessary facts and speculations. For example, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2b99qVA&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, author quotes his sources like its a freaking science book: with page numbers! Do I really care what in exactly what month each Disney movie was released and all the details of its production? NO! 🚫&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I listened to three of them and all three of them despite high reviews (herd mentality?) are terrible, boring (even at 1.5x) and full of uncertainties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2blUtjM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2bHjI1V&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2b99qVA&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About uncertainties—that’s my other beef with biographies. Why do authors have a need to psychoanalyze the hero? Just list the facts and move on. Why they feel the urge to present multiple accounts? Pick one side and tell a story. Humans love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, they try to stay neutral. Authors need to have an opinion. It’s like talking to someone. That someone needs to have an opinion. Without authors having filters, it’s just a boring text book. Well, judging by the length they are textbooks! 📚&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to myself: &lt;strong&gt;stop “reading” biographies&lt;/strong&gt;. They are waste of time! &lt;em&gt;Start reading and listening more to autobiographies instead&lt;/em&gt;. They are livelier, full of opinions which makes them congruent and just overall have better story lines sans boring facts… and they are shorter because interesting successful people understand that they shouldn’t waste other people’s time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I’m getting close to my new goal of 100 books per year with just 35 to go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Pay a Full Price</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/full-price/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10  Aug 2016 11:23:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/full-price/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me share a little secret. 😉  While it’s nice to get a discount and save a few bucks, especially when you’re going to buy a thing anyway, there is something magical in when you pay a full price. You’ll tend to enjoy the thing more, feel better about yourself and use the thing more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that this phenomenon of getting benefits of paying the full price (or a premium) is even more applicable to buying something special, something experiential such as an online course, a music CD (which see only at Whole Foods and Starbucks checkout lines), or an event like a seminar or a conference. How many online courses or books did you buy on at a discount and never finished them? 📖 I bet way, way more than the ones for which you’ve paid a full price (and a high one)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human brains are wired to appreciate according to the price you’ve paid so buy torrenting a book or a movie or buy looking for coupons to your favorite artists’ or speaker’s performance—you are robbing yourself from a pleasure. It took me a while to realize it, but once I did 💡, I started buying music on iTunes and now subscribe to Spotify as a way to appreciate and give back to my favorite artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With commodities, which are all the same, you can get the same sweet potato chips from any website which sells them, so buying the cheapest and most convenient is less damaging to the pleasure (but still is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why luxury industry exists. The quality of a Gucci bag is not 100 times better. It’s roughly the same. The bonus is in the enjoyment. This principle applies to non-monetary payment, for example when working on a book or a PhD—that’s hard and painful sometimes. However, most people treasure the results and outcomes more after a tougher journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So either pay a full price or pretend that you did (and then forget that you pretended), because you’ll get more usage of whatever that thing is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Paradoxes</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/paradoxes/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Jul 2016 11:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/paradoxes/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that there are a lot of paradoxes when it comes to attitudes and life which you can’t easily solve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on doing vs. learning and expanding your horizons: You need to keep up with the latest stuff, meet new people and generate new ideas by exploring new things but you need to focus on the tasks at hand to see them through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patience vs. obsession (hard work): You need to give enough time for something great to materialize (10,000 hours, over night success which takes 10 years, etc.), but at the same time when you work hard and obsess, that’s when you see more short-term results and build momentum. Marathon or a sprint?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence vs. humility (being open to being wrong and feedback): You must be confident to overcome obstacles, yet at the same time it’s important to be receptive to feedback and improve on/learn from on your mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying “no” to opportunities vs. saying “yes to them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing vs. adapting: Sometimes it’s good to change your provider, environment, equipment, etc., while other times, you just have to suck it up and not worry about mundane things which might annoy you otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on weekends and have no vacations vs. taking time off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay in one place vs. living a digital nomad life: Staying in one place are more comfortable and allows to establish connections and network (it’s who you know, not what you know most of the times even in tech); while traveling allows to expand horizon, and explore new opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being analytics vs. artistic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being good with tech&amp;amp;numbers vs. being good with people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing is to be doing both of these extremes, but they are extremes for a reason. How to be humble yet confident? Or how to stay and build connections and reputation in one area but bring new ideas from other spheres of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The million dollar question is how do you tell the difference when to pick what option? Maybe you need to take it to extremes to know your limit and that will eventually allow you to find balances easier? To put it differently, &lt;strong&gt;wisdom to remove paradoxes or act on both of their extremes harmoniously comes with practice and time&lt;/strong&gt;. Or is there a magic formula with criteria to follow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I would consider myself a person who likes to do things in a batch by focusing on one thing and see it through completion. For example, implementing a feature in an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are certain tasks which you simply cannot finish in a few days, like writing a book, building strength in your body or learning a new language. It’s better to turn the work on those things into habits. Just do a little bit every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that instead of results which are often fluctuate in time (e.g., writing 500 words everyday), it’s better to block time, let’s say one hour on my new book and 30 minutes on learning Spanish &lt;strong&gt;everyday, even weekends and vacations&lt;/strong&gt;.  After a few days those activities becomes not very dissimilar to brushing your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can accomplish a lot by doing small and simple things every day. I started with doing 10 push-ups and 20 sits up every morning a year ago. Now, I’m on to doing 100 sit ups and 50 push ups effortlessly. Chunk down your large projects and be consistent in the execution!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Listening to Customers is Bad?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/customers/working-in-starbucks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often hear that we need to listen to our customers/users from business, marketing and product development gurus. A popular Lean Startup methodology teaches to make as many experiments to learn about customers, their needs and wants. Zig Ziglar, Jim Rohn and Tony Robbins said something along the lines of: if you help enough people, you can achieve anything. Everyone seems to be crazy about customer satisfaction. Do we live in a tyranny of a customer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’m re-writing my new book React Quickly, there are some concepts I don’t agree with. However, the book reviewers told me they want the book to cover certain things, so here I am, catering to my customer. What is the majority is not right? What if there’s something morally or ethically wrong with the thing that the majority of customers want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, there are plenty examples when majority, and democracy in particular, made wrong decisions. So does it make people who like to create a great product, company or business also morally or ethically wrong in the long run, just because they listened to their customers with their wrong ideas and they knew the ideas were wrong? Something to think about. Maybe the perfect approach is to know what your customers want, but give them what they need (and what’s right).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Newbie Forever</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/newbie-forever/Right_before_starting_my_presentation_about_Node_Patterns_From_Callbacks_to_Observer_at__NodePDX__Software__Technology__WebDevelopment__Java__JavaScript__Python__Ruby__Node.js__Angular__React.js__iOS__BigData__FinTech__Startups__Tech__code__program__.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Right before starting my presentation about Node Patterns: From Callbacks to Observer at NodePDX 2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a note to myself: the more I can be comfortable being newbie the more I can keep up the pace with current events, tech and apps. The reason being, it’s not enough to master one tech or app and assume it won’t change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the popularity of SaaS and web apps, they are constantly updated without us even asking us! You can forget about an app and comeback to it six month later—it’ll could be a &lt;strong&gt;completely&lt;/strong&gt; new app. You’ll have to learn where all the menus and buttons all over again. Learn to love it. Future apps will update even faster. Same happens with open source and programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the more you stay behind the worse the pain of an upgrade later. There is no way around it. Just &lt;em&gt;embrace being newbie forever, because the faster you learn the more comfortable you’ll be in using the recent tech&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Learning fast is your competitive advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you can’t keep re-learning all the things continuously, that’s why focusing on a specific area is paramount. Therefore, focus, learn, re-learn and don’t afraid to be a newbie because being newbie is and will be our normal state. Being newbie is forever.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/not-shy/work.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to think that someone is shy just because he/she is not talking to anyone or not going to social events… Although this might be true, I came to the conclusion that there is another reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to &lt;strong&gt;do things&lt;/strong&gt; instead of talking. While some conversations are insightful. For example, talking with your colleagues or customers is paramount for maintaining good communication. Other social chat is not just boring but mostly a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I’m not shy. I’m just biased towards taking action instead of useless talking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PaleoFX 2016</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/paleofx-2016/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/paleofx-2016/panel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PaleoFX 2016 Panel: Paleo is growing bigger and business helps it&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote before about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers&quot;&gt;being on a paleo lifestyle is like having superpowers&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, I was lucky to attend PaleoFX, the biggest Paleo conference. It was kind of surreal to be around thousands of like-minded people, to see in-person almost all famous New York Times #1 Best-Sellers paleolebrities, and to be surrounded with all kinds of safe paleo-friendly food&amp;amp;drinks. Here are some of the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paleo business is growing: There were all kind of paleo flours, sweets, bars, powders, broths, fats and coffee infused with just about anything (butter, coconut, even mushrooms!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paleolebrities are regular people: most of them hang out at the expo or after giving their presentations to answer questions. I took a picture with Robb Wolf with who’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1t8KS6J&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; my paleo journey started 6 years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were insane number of healthy and fit looking people doing workout workshops (inspiring) as well as &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; looking people (making it less intimidating).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bone broth is liquid gold: I knew that broth is healing but after listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1VDS2dY&quot;&gt;Dr. Kellyann&lt;/a&gt; I decided to become disciplined about drinking 2 cups of bone broth. Her protocol is bone broth for 21 days and fast 1-2 days per week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/paleo16&quot;&gt;Ben Greenfield’s presentation&lt;/a&gt; was full of bio hacks to increase cognitive performance like jaw realignment, morning brain flush, infra-red saunas, yoga, low intensity PEMF and others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our gut bacteria has more DNA material than we: &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1VDS2uC&quot;&gt;Dr. Perlmutter&lt;/a&gt; gave a great presentation reinforcing the importance of our gut biome. One of the analogies stuck with me: we uploaded our DNA/genes to the cloud which is our gut bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of sleep is aging and killing you faster: Just one night of sleep deprivation increases aging 10-15 years (temporarily) and decreases cognitive functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s harder to legally sell raw milk than marijuana (in some cases).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BF_4shkiXN9/?taken-by=azat_co&quot;&gt;A lot of science is not reliable&lt;/a&gt;, because studies to replicate findings and peer reviews are disincentivized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a great event to reinforce familiar, and learn new things about paleo lifestyle. I also got a lot of contacts for paleo-friendly web stores, products and services which will make my life on the paleo lifestyle even easier than before!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fisherman and the Businessman B.S.</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/fisherman-and-businessman/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Apr 2016 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/fisherman-and-businessman/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/fisherman-and-businessman/fish.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the preamble about &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulocoelhoblog.com/2015/09/04/the-fisherman-and-the-businessman&quot;&gt;the fisherman and the businessman&lt;/a&gt;? It’s often told in a feel-good blogs and talks. The fisherman’s nationality varies from Brazilian to Mexican, but the gist is that you don’t have to strive for success and achievement. If all you want to do if is to fish and go home early, then you can start doing it now (fisherman). In other words, if your goal is to relax after you’ve made money (businessman), then why not skip making money part and relax now ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it’s utterly &lt;strong&gt;bullshit&lt;/strong&gt;—and potentially dangerous for those who take its advice seriously—for three reasons. The first is simple: the story don’t take into consideration &lt;em&gt;risks&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s say your family member gets sick. If you have the money, you can send him/her to a good hospital. This is not an option for a poor fisherman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason is the experience, adventure, the thrill and &lt;em&gt;satisfaction&lt;/em&gt; of making money, doing well in your craft (fishing and business management), career or business. This is the reward in itself for most people in the world of business. Think of it as the journey which will make you a better person. If all you do is fish, go home early and relax, then you are not challenging yourself enough. You’re not growing in your craft or skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last reason is that if you just fish for your family, then you deprive other of the fruits of your labor. If you’re any good (and with practice and time you should become good at pretty much any trade), then you’ll be depriving others, e.g., people in a seafood market, of your fish. So staying at your current level and not taking it bigger is stealing from society. &lt;strong&gt;It’s selfish&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t believe all the stupid stories you read or hear from the so called gurus of life. Think for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Success is Boring</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/success-is-boring/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2015 11:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/success-is-boring/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/success-is-boring/success-is-boring.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is what we crave. Parents, peers and culture pushes success down our throats as it’s the best thing ever. Yet not many people claim success in their lives. They jump from one hot opportunity to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day they are building SaaS, the next month consulting, and then selling cheap privately labeled and growth-hacked shit on Amazon.com. It’s like an addiction. Starting a business is easy. Starting micro businesses like SaaS, info product or private label is extremely easier than managing brick and mortar. &lt;em&gt;Entrepreneur become parallel entrepreneur.&lt;/em&gt; They juggle multiple things. Each is moderately successful, but nothing great… why? Because success is boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people like the thrill more than success.&lt;/strong&gt; Like many thrill seekers they deny this fact. They sabotage their success. They are like gamblers who hit the slot machines and frustrated by the interrupted flow of their trance when they actually do win. The adrenaline junkies, those people love to start new venture and see them succeed from 0 to 60, but they never stay long enough to see any really great fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people like the inviting adventure of new projects more than the steady long-term progress of establishing ones. If you need serendipity go pick up a new sport (surfing, rock climbing, Krav Maga) or learn how to ride a motorcycle, but don’t bet your career on a risky proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this post mostly for myself to stay focused and as a reminder that &lt;strong&gt;real success is boring&lt;/strong&gt;. Find the thing you’re great at and which is in demand and valued by others. Then, you stick with it unless you fully get its potential. It might be 5, 10 or 15 years. Give it a time. Everything great takes time. Otherwise we won’t treasure it that much. Boring is good.  You have my permission to be boring… and achieve the success you want be it personal life, health or business.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pursuit of Happiness as The Major Source of Unhappiness or Why Happiness is Overrated</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/happiness/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2015 12:05:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/happiness/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/happiness/cactus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I think about happiness, the more I come to the conclusion that it’s overrated. Maybe it’s even detrimental to actually living a productive and healthy live. You see, evolutionary &lt;strong&gt;humans weren’t designed to be happy all the time&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, you’re having a great day, maybe you made progress on a project, then you have think what would make you happy and boom—the mood goes down if you don’t get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is simply not wired into our brains and nervous system by millions of years of evolution. &lt;strong&gt;Humans were designed to survive&lt;/strong&gt;, and survival doesn’t mean happiness. Survival is at the bottom of the Maslow’s pyramid, and it’s what our oldest brain is doing perfectly. Why work hard trying to achieve something you’re doing sub-optimally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower expectations bring more satisfaction, right? Once I realized that we weren’t born to be happy, I had an epiphany which liberated me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forget about this illusive happiness. In the never-ending pursuit of it, you’ll remain miserable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop thinking that you’re supposed to be happy all the time. Banish the entitled to feel good or thoughts on how to achieve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just live in the moment, survive and be productive, instead of worrying about illusive feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop pursuing happiness; search meaning in your life instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You only live once, but not in the context of how most people think about this phrase such as: party, drink, reward or entertain yourself. In other words, they justify some epicurean activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, I use YOLO when I’m deciding to take on new projects, work, or tasks. My mindset is to create as many useful things as possible. Time is the only finite resource that we, humans, have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t postpone any longer something you wanted to do yesterday or last year. Time will pass anyway… So don’t spend your time on frivolous activities. Make your time count big time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Be ignorant about everything except two or three things you are really interested about. Those things are your priorities and dream goals. Everything else is a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The myth that we can do everything, should know about a variety of subjects and accomplish everything is just a myth. &lt;strong&gt;You cannot be everywhere and do everything…&lt;/strong&gt; If you try, the outcome is mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free&amp;Easy Hosting</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/github-pages/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2015 15:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/github-pages/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tech advice: if you need a simple website for your project, then use &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt;. It’s free and better than cheap $4.99/mo hosting, which can be easily hacked, is slow and requires you to use cPanel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you’ll need to get your website up and running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create account on GitHub (do it once).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send your developer a link to that repository, and a Twitter Bootstrap theme of your choice (Google it if you don’t know where to get a beatiful theme).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point your CNAME records in Godaddy, or whatever you’re using, to GitHub IPs (192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.154).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge pull request from you developer on GitHub.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boom! You’ve got your website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this technique for my 10+ websites, some of them quite fancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rpjs.co&quot;&gt;http://rpjs.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://150x.co&quot;&gt;http://150x.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co&quot;&gt;http://azat.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://proexpressjs.com&quot;&gt;http://proexpressjs.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://expressjsguide.com&quot;&gt;http://expressjsguide.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog&quot;&gt;http://azat.co/blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nodeprogram.com&quot;&gt;http://nodeprogram.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s no need for WordPress or PHP. GitHub Pages is free and it is faster than BlueHost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site must be static only without any PHP, Node.js or any other server-side logic. You can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxyform.com&quot;&gt;foxyform&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emailmeform.com&quot;&gt;EmailMeForm&lt;/a&gt; for contact forms, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://gumroad.com&quot;&gt;Gumroad&lt;/a&gt; for sales. For blogs, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://wintersmith.io&quot;&gt;Wintersmith&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the famous TV show Man vs. Food, I went on a 7-day BBQ challenge. &lt;em&gt;Please don’t try this at home&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://azat.co/images/blog/10611050_340871606075312_1200209688_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Just kidding! I lasted only three days, because apparently cole slaw and sweet potato fries weren’t enough veggie for me. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All Restaurants Are Bad</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/all-restaurants-are-bad/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05  Aug 2014 15:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/all-restaurants-are-bad/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We love to go out and treat ourselves to nice meals! But it’s unhealty, because almost all US restaurants are bad for you in &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/fast-food-paleo-style&quot;&gt;the long run&lt;/a&gt;. Why? This is a common sense and it has to do with us when we favor cheaper places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for restaurants to stay in business they need to generate profits and cut costs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would a restaurant use more expensive extra virgin olive or coconut oil instead of cheap vegetable (mutant) oils like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marksdailyapple.com/dear-mark-canola-oil&quot;&gt;Canola&lt;/a&gt;? No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would they use more expensive wild caught fish (especially salmon in sushi places) instead of antibiotic-filled farm-raised one? No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would they use more expensive organic vegetables and fruits instead of conventional ones? No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would they use more expensive organic grass-fed meat and poultry instead of conventional grain-fed one? No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when we vote with our dollars, we shouldn’t just choose cheaper places. If we continue doing it, organic good food will never become mainstream and cheap. Same thing happened with high-speed airlines: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde&quot;&gt;Concorde&lt;/a&gt; became extinct because passengers preferred cheaper but slower flying options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if it’s too expensive to eat at a good place like &lt;a href=&quot;http://laughingplanetcafe.com&quot;&gt;Laughing Planet&lt;/a&gt;? Just cook at home! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Paleo is Like Having Superpowers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years of being on a paleo lifestyle, I’ve noticed that I don’t want to go back to the S.A.D (Standard American Diet), for the reason that living on paleo feel is akin to &lt;strong&gt;having superpowers&lt;/strong&gt;. I just don’t want to give up these perks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t get food coma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t crave sugary treats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t get cold or flu&lt;/strong&gt; as often (this year I took zero sick days!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have more energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can skip meals (when I travel or for fasting) and don’t feel bad, exhausted or anxious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spend less time shopping because a lot of food options eliminated (cereals, breads, cakes, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have &lt;strong&gt;more free time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why someone wouldn’t want to be a real-life action hero?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fast Food Paleo Style</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, we are on the go, have to travel or just want to indulge in the staple of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_American_Diet&quot;&gt;standard American diet&lt;/a&gt; (SAD) — fast food. Personally, I find most fast food restaurants convenient. They are quick, offer a good value and have  predictable quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos-h.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xfp1/10354485_1503576039861887_341941421_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salad with proteins (chicken or beef) and without croutons/bread/corn/grains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burgers without buns, some places call them “wrapped in lettuces”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos-a.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xaf1/917265_459351284170824_997640800_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing wrong with treating yourself once in a while to a small side of french fries (with garlic, yum!) or a smoothie/milk shake. Even Mark Sisson says that we should’t be hard on ourselves all the time (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marksdailyapple.com/8020-principle/&quot;&gt;80/20 rule&lt;/a&gt;). Just be careful not to make it a daily (or for some even a weekly trip can be dangerous) meal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/927868_498328226951733_1006424496_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite joints are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.superdupersf.com/&quot;&gt;SuperDuper Burgers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chipotle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Panera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixt Greens / Chop’t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;McDonald’s&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico is only 9-11 hours driving from the Bay Area. It’s a relatively large port city that serves as tourist cruises port of call. It has nice Pacific Ocean views and great seafood. The commerce is thriving on the US border with street vendors, acrobats and windshield window washers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-prn/t51.2885-15/1963154_1423660997884988_706200877_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Hard not to love this place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Crimean War</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/the-crimean-war/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2014 14:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/the-crimean-war/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In lieu of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2014/ukraine/&quot;&gt;events&lt;/a&gt; that started in December 2013 and still are happening in Ukraine (originally part of the Russian Empire and then the USSR), events that resulted in Crimea becoming a part of Russian Federation, I picked up a book about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War&quot;&gt;Crimean War&lt;/a&gt; of 1853-56. The book turned out to be a longer than I expected, about 600 pages, but I enjoyed every single page of it because the author gives such a good geopolitical picture of what was going on before and after the war, as well as the atmosphere and trends of the major part of the 19th century. The book is called &lt;strong&gt;The Crimean War: A History by Orlando Figes&lt;/strong&gt; and it’s available in &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1krSGWg&quot;&gt;Kindle on Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I vaguely remember the very brief coverage of the Crimean War during my high school history class: something about the heroism of soldiers and Russian backwards technologies. It was good to look at the events from the British author’s point of view. Here are the things the surprised and impressed me the most:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Crimean War was the first modern war which involved heavy industrialized manufacturing — at least on the side of France and the British Empire — and the attrition warfare closely resembled World War I.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The public opinion was the major factor influencing French, British and Russian rulers in entering and ending the conflict — just like now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The war started for many geopolitical (weakening of the Ottoman Empire), populist (the British press was very anti-Russian) and personal agendas (Nicholas I believed in the holy mission and the third Rome idea, and Napoleon III needed a victory to increase his influence).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody liked the poor Turks, not even their French and British allies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were highly effective and flamboyant French &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouave&quot;&gt;Zouave troops&lt;/a&gt; after which the American Civil War Zouaves were modeled just a few years later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, not many things have changed over 160 years in terms of the influence of public opinion and attempts at controlling it. Back then, the British Empire had &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; press, but there was some censorship of photography and in the army, e.g., the officers writing about the horrors of the first winter were considered traitors by their commanders. Orlando writes that the French emperor Napoleon III had spies everywhere and a tight grip on the press with censorship. The same things were true for the Russian Tsar Nicholas I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that changed dramatically was the speed of communication. The news traveled very slowly during the Crimean War — it took a few days in the beginning of the conflict for the news to reach its destination until the telegraph line was laid under the Black Sea (for the allies). Now, we can just sit in the comfort of our homes, scanning Twitter with the #Ukraine hashtag, and getting real-time updates, photos and even live streams of events miles away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Twitter stops indexing search results after a couple of days, so you might want to try Storify for historical searches, e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://storify.com/search?q=ukraine&quot;&gt;https://storify.com/search?q=ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pioneer Nation 2014, D.I.Y. Revolution and Oregon Adventure</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/pioneer-nation-2014-diy-revolution-and-oregon-adventure/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pioneer Nation conference was all about living your dream. It was held in Portland, Oregon. I was due for a vacation after &lt;a href=&quot;http://webapplog.com/growth-hacking-the-new-docusign-experience/&quot;&gt;DocuSign Momentum&lt;/a&gt; and always wanted to visit this city, so the excuse was perfect. It turned out to be a perfect rainy getaway from the tiresome dry, sunny, and hot Bay area winter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://azat.co/images/blog/1171929_1480333745528775_71596623_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tiny Alaska Airline plane from rainy Oakland, CA to rainy Portland, OR&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was headed to the inaugural Pioneer Nation 2014 conference. I found out about this event almost by accident. Firstly, a few people whose opinions I respect suggested the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worlddominationsummit.com/&quot;&gt;World Domination Summit&lt;/a&gt; which is another conference in Portland organized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisguillebeau.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Guillebeau&lt;/a&gt; et al. Chris is the author of inspirational &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0067TGSOK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0067TGSOK&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=rpjs-20&quot;&gt;The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future &lt;/a&gt;. I signed up for the sale notification to WDS, but missed the second ticket sale wave by only a few hours. I checked my email at night and 500 tickets were sold, with the email blast having just gone out that morning. What a high demand; good job, Chris! That’s how I learned about Pioneer Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of PN is simple: create your dream job, escape 9-5, and be an entrepreneur. This is more in line with my mood than WDS, which is more general and not all about business. Also PN is smaller in attendance than WDS, which was held three times already (or something like that). Because of that, not getting a ticket to the World Domination Summit allowed me to come to Pioneer Nation, so the outcome was to my benefit. I’m happy about the &lt;em&gt;fortuna&lt;/em&gt; despite the former being a better cocktail party conversation starter than the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://azat.co/images/blog/915545_852898578070735_1051820088_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Nines lounge view on downtown Portland, OR&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Pioneer Nation, about 400 of us socialized, listened to talks, and applied what we learned right away at workshops. For those of you who have read/listened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0067TGSOK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0067TGSOK&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=rpjs-20&quot;&gt;The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future &lt;/a&gt;, it’s a very good book with a lot of case studies and inspirational stories (We &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; love stories, right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed at a wonderful place in Kenton, which I later discovered belongs to and is run by entrepreneurs and Pioneer Nation volunteers! The Kenton neighborhood is famous for its statue of a lumberjack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://azat.co/images/blog/7b1b99bed0ec11e385a50002c99c24ec_8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Kenton statue, Portland, OR&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before committing to the trip, I lowered my expectations, and the plan was to enjoy my vacation, visit Portland and &lt;strong&gt;take the train&lt;/strong&gt; (Coast Starlight) back to the Bay Area. But the event turned out really well. I learned quite a few cool new things, met with interesting and inspiring people and came back for tons of new ideas. My main take aways—besides the nice swag that they gave us, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://nathanbarry.com/authority/&quot;&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt;(thank you Nathan Barry!), hoodie, mug and compass—are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a marketing plan and calendar, and be disciplined and strategic about them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video courses are huge right now. I rejected the &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/pioneer-nation-2014-diy-revolution-and-oregon-adventure/packtpub.com&quot;&gt;PacktPub&lt;/a&gt; offer to do the Express.js video course in order to produce mine independently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris Brogan’s quote: “Usually it’s not the book-smartest who succeed, because those people never start, but the other people: they don’t know stuff, but they start anyway”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just a side note: Portland has good coffee and lots and lots of organic juice bars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The path to new age entrepreneurship is doable and doesn’t take long: most of the speakers been doing this entrepreneurial thing only for about 2-4 years. In some of the break-out sessions, speakers were sitting in on the other sessions and learning something themselves!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://azat.co/images/blog/1725358_263223593850349_1742201531_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I’m full of motivation and have a new mini-community of creative risk-takers. Go pioneers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://azat.co/images/blog/40d93f52b62211e3bc1b0eccfd8aa9b3_8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way back, I took the Coast Starlight train for the sake of adventure, scenic views and ability to get started on my new book &lt;a href=&quot;http://progwriter.com&quot;&gt;ProgWriter&lt;/a&gt;. The lack of WiFi internet didn’t bother me because I had MoFi (but never needed to use it). I actually found it better not to be interrupted by the Internet research when I was writing. Needless to say, the ride was spectacular and surprisingly convenient: there was more legroom in coach than in a business class airplane seat. The conversations and people who travel on trains were amazing. I met with a city counsel of Bend, OR (a town near Mount Bachelor ski resort in the middle of Oregon), and she told me about their BYOJ (bring your own job) and startup initiatives. By dusk when we were crossing the Cascades, there was snow and scenic views. Maybe I should travel with Amtrak more often?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m starting my personal blog and this is its first post. This blog unlike webapplog will contain &lt;strong&gt;zero coding&lt;/strong&gt;, and lots of musings, instagrams and rants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might guess that blog is built with Node.js-powered Wintersmith static site generator. The Ghost just can’t compete with the simplier set up that Wintersmith has.&lt;/p&gt;
