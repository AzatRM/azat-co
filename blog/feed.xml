      <title>Work and Rest</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Working is important. It not only provides material means, social status and pride in a well work done, but also meaning and motivation which in tern extend a person‚Äôs life. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2016/03/21/jech-2015-207097.short&quot;&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt;, people who retire and don‚Äôt find another activity, die fast. Or that tech millionaires are unhappy once they are let go or fire, or that lottery winners are miss the working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, resting is important too and helps to avoid burn-out and all kids of nasty nervous diseases which tend to decrease one‚Äôs life. Working productively while having rest once in a while is the best approach. üë®‚ÄçüíªüîÑüõå  &lt;strong&gt;What‚Äôs crazy is that many people do things which they think is resting but in fact they are draining their energy even more.&lt;/strong&gt; Here are some of these things. Some of them might shock you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going out on the weekend: Breaking your sleep cycle with loud noise, excessive drinking or eating - not good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traveling, especially stressful traveling: Being in a nice place taken care of by the hotel staff and restaurants is nice but the traveling itself is almost always a stress (airport, planes, traffic). Trying new food and changing time zones are bad stressors to. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching sports, TV shows or news: they all drain your energy because your body is passive yet emotions and adrenaline glands are not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being on social media: More people feel depressed after using social media due to ‚Äúsuccess theatre‚Äù and the addiction mechanism of novelty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multitasking: Not being in the present and flow state, e.g., when you at your kids soccer game, don‚Äôt text with work. That‚Äôs a disservice to you, work and your family. Be present whatever you do. Put your phone on an airplane mode. Most likely you are not a firefighter or a brain surgeon. You work can wait until the weekend is over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not sleeping enough or waking up on the weekend at different hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating refined carbs (pizza, pasta, juices, smoothies): Sugar is easily digestible form spike insulin and very toxic for your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not getting resistance training and doing too much chronic cardio: Chronic cardio is a huge stressor, tough on joints and ages people fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoking weed: If smoking tobacco causes cancer due to the burned stuff that people inhale, then why burning weed and smoking it &lt;em&gt;wouldn‚Äôt&lt;/em&gt; cause cancer too?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hanging out with ‚Äúfriends‚Äù: Wrong type of friends can bring drama and having too much drama in your life is not good for mental health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Postponing important things, i.e., procrastination: It might feel good short-term to postpone an important project or a decision but it‚Äôll snowball stress in the long-term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are probably more things which are misleading to people. They mask as rest but actually suck up your energy. I would say not watching news or TV shows and having enough sleep are two most important which will give the majority the most bang for their buck. Focus on that if you feel tired!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Snowball Change ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/snowball-change/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I had a lot of changes. And I‚Äôll have more until the end of year! It started with a small one. I upgraded my laptop. The tool which I use 8-10 hours everyday. Then I changed the place of living‚Ä¶ and did other &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; big life changes. Small things lead to big changes. It‚Äôs a snowball. I remember something about cognitive dissonance. Probably that‚Äôs it. If you are decisive and not afraid of changes for good, then it translates to other areas of life and work‚Ä¶ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What‚Äôs funny is that every big change which I did was perceived as bigger before but in fact was 10x easier. The lesson: &lt;strong&gt;don‚Äôt think changing is hard&lt;/strong&gt;. Stop your mind when it starts to envision any problems or hurdles  which might not even materialize. Of course, account for the worse scenario but don‚Äôt paralyze yourself with excessive analysis. &lt;em&gt;Avoid analysis paralysis by taking action even if it‚Äôs a small action at first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Get More Motivation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people think they lack motivation. They feel lazy. They listen to Gary Vaynerchuk or Tony Robinns. It might help for a while but why not solve the problem at the root cause? What these people really lack is a big enough ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. They become complacent because most of their needs are met. Simply take on more and larger responsibilities and you‚Äôll be motivated. Get new bigger problems to solve. Find a new job, get married, start a family, have kids, sign a book contract, start or buy a business. You‚Äôll see your motivation will skyrocket, and the complacency will decrease!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Live a Stress-Free Life</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/stress/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12  Aug 2017 10:44:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/stress/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The title of this post is really a misnomer because a stress-free life is nothing good. Stress helps us grow and it‚Äôs usually a good thing when there‚Äôs enough time to recover, recuperate and heal. Think going to a gym. You exercise, which is a form of stress, but after a recovery period you become stronger. Humans evolutionary evolved to thrive under this type of acute stress followed by recovery (catabolic and anabolic processes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However there‚Äôs another type of stress which is called prolonged or chronic stress. This type of stress is detrimental because it does NOT allow for a recovery period. For example, thinking about an up-coming test for your final exam, a job interview or not being able to pay your mortgage because you got fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid this bad chronic stress is just to avoid thinking about it. Most problems are not even real. They are products of our imagination. The longer you procrastinate and overanalyze, the worse the overwhelm, fear and stress become. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes it worse is that our brains can‚Äôt handle more than 4-5 items in our conscious minds. When you day dream or analyze in your mind (like in a shower or before going to bed), most likely later you‚Äôll forget whatever the ideas, steps or details you thought about. This will add to stress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a dedicated time to think. Mark it in your calendar. Write the steps, details and questions in a notebook or in an application. Looking at a todo list or a high-level outline will bring you calmness and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, you can take action which will clear and dispel the fears and imagined problems. All you need to complete a big task is just to know what are the next actionable steps, and take them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best way to deal with procrastination is to tell yourself that you‚Äôll just start on a task or see how to write the first page (for a book) or create the first file (for a program). The mind will want to continue by inertia once you get into the flow and pick up momentum by seeing results.  So you can trick it by just starting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pomodoro technique uses 25 minute chunks to trick the brain into starting by limiting to ‚Äúexposure‚Äù to a task to 25 minutes which will typically turn into another 25 minutes and then to another 25 minutes until you get to some milestone on a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last tip, don‚Äôt load your mind with tasks or problems unless you can either solve them right away or make a note to work on them later. Doing so will occupy your mind but you can‚Äôt accomplish the task right away. Remember, your brain can hold only several items in the conscious mind at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, don‚Äôt check your email on your phone in a metro, because there would be emails which will require you to use a computer.  It‚Äôs easier to read an email and do the task right away, than to read it, mark as ‚Äútodo later‚Äù or unread, then come back to it, read again and do the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, avoid chronic stress by taking action and avoiding over thinking especially thinking without taking notes. Planning and taking action beat any overwhelm and procrastination. At the same time, indulge in acute stress once in a while to continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>About Efficiency, Digital and Remote Work</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/digital-life/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Needless to say that cafes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/open-offices&quot;&gt;open offices&lt;/a&gt;, commute and slow internet all impede productivity. To increase efficiency, distraction-free &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/flow&quot;&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt; and productivity, I stayed home for a few days over the weekend to work on a project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished the project and made some money all digitally and remotely via the Internet and phone. I ordered food (groceries) using food delivery services. I worked out in a gym in my building and got fresh air on my patio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was an weird feeling that I don‚Äôt need to leave my home at all. It‚Äôs almost magical to realize the digital inflow of money and digital outflow (to pay for food). Also, I was healthier because I cooked at home instead of eating out, and I didn‚Äôt listen to gossips or read/watch news even in passing on a gym‚Äôs TV or in metro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs fascinating that all can be done digitally witout leaving one‚Äôs home and it‚Äôs peculiar how little humans needs sometimes for productive, satisfactory and healthy live.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Right and Wrong Ways to Delegate</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/delegation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Jul 2017 16:22:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/delegation/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My main jobs are software engineering and writing. They are crafts and as with many crafts they are harder to delegate. Think mass produced car vs. designing a car and the factory to mass produce it. Software and books are scalable because they can be replicated infinitely without any loss, but the actual act of writing them is a creative hard-to-scale process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years of writing software and books, I‚Äôve been learning to identify and delegate some repeatable tasks. I learned that the right way to delegate is to find a repeatable task which you know a) cannot be easily automated b) needs to be performed 100+ times or 2+ hours, and c) straightforward to document and explain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs a cost of review. Do not skip reviewing the end work and either fixing mistakes yourself or sending it back for a re-work (in this case always review again). Reviewing helps not only to make a better product but it‚Äôll give you the confidence in your product and your team (or not but then you at least know and can fix issue later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some leader say, never delegate things you are not willing to do yourself. It‚Äôs B.S. Everything is situational. I delegated things I dreaded doing and they got done. If I didn‚Äôt delegate them, they could have taken longer (procrastination) or would have never materialized at all. Done is better than perfect in this case. However, running at least the first 3-4 times through the routine will help you greatly in writing instructions and standard operation procedures (SOPs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not delegate to perform things which do not make sense financially and don‚Äôt be cheap on things which will generate revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delegate at things you think you are okay or good (even worse), but in reality you suck at. For example, a lot of programmers think they are good at design and their confidence leads to terrible websites, book covers and software which prevents them from making more sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize this post, do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate to get better supplemental skill to your own and don‚Äôt be cheap, e.g.,design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change process to eliminate or automate, e.g., create a self-service instead of customer support or use AWS RDS instead of maintaining a database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate repeatable tasks by having detailed easy to follow instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always review before the final step&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate scary for you tasks but only after you‚Äôve done them a few times and they‚Äôve stopped being scary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly re-evaluate, i.e., look for opportunities to change to a cheaper provider or simplify the process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delegate to get a second opinion, e.g., tech review, copy editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example of things you &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; shouldn‚Äôt be doing yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design (for programmers or writers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scheduling appointments by phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixing formatting, links, code, fonts, etc. in MS Word, Markdown, and other formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First pass at creating captions and transcriptons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First pass at video editing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spinning up and maintaining your own database instead of using BaaS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spinning up and maintaining your own servers (virtual machines) instead of using PaaS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Importing, exporting, enrolling instead of automating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submitting to any forms: job boards, conferences (request for proposals), clients, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posting to social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploying code instead of having CD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing code instead of having CI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not delegate (or automate) things when one or more applies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will  faster for you to do it and it‚Äôs not a repeatable task then to train and review (review can take a long time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs a last step review&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs hard to describe (means creative) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs a core function for you &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires extremely high standards which will cost you too much or hard to find people to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs marketing/sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Changing Unconscious</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/changing-unconscious/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2017 12:24:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/changing-unconscious/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I was reviewing transcripts for one of my Node University courses, I was surprised to see so many ‚Äúso‚Äù, ‚Äúum‚Äù, and ‚Äúah‚Äù filler words. It was a very painful experience to realize that your speech is far from perfect. Of course, with training most people can improve their speech: avoid filler words, accents and improve intonation. This is what professional voice actors, news anchors and movie stars did. And they are in high demand and popular! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it, a lot of improvements to the unconscious actions such as speech, language, writing, personal finance (it‚Äôs defined by habits not logic), eating and fitness are the &lt;strong&gt;hardest&lt;/strong&gt;, but they bring the most rewards once you make the changes. Unconscious changes are the hardest, but at the same time they are the &lt;em&gt;easiest&lt;/em&gt; to maintain once acquired. The reason is that there‚Äôs an autopilot effect. The reward part comes from the fact that there are fewer people who can change those unconscious things in or around them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you train yourself to speak well, you can become a Pluralsight course author or a paid public speaker. If you invest time and effort in Spanish, you can speak it without translating from English to Spanish. Not many people can do either of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unconscious autopilots are great, but tweaking them takes time and efforts. Ego is crushed which makes for less competition. &lt;em&gt;There are no traffic jams on the extra mile&lt;/em&gt;. The good thing is that once you applied the change, everything can go back to the autopilot: now you &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers&quot;&gt;eat healthy&lt;/a&gt; without thinking about it, &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/flow&quot;&gt;focus quicker&lt;/a&gt; and read more of good &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/200-books&quot;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs funny how things work but knowing that there‚Äôs a big reward ahead if you can tweak a bad unconscious habit into a good one creates a good motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm almost done listening to an audiobook  &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2rtrSir&quot;&gt;A Man for All Markets&lt;/a&gt; read by its author and I‚Äôm fascinated by two things. First, the parallels between risk, casino, gambling and the stock market. Second, the fact that the author was innovating and constantly moving forward into areas which are still not saturated and still unproved away from techniques and areas which became more competitive and mainstream. Natural curiosity and data-driven non-emotional approach helped the author a lot! These are my notes about the book which I highly recommend reading, so if next time someone tells you that the casino always wins, your can refer them to this book which proved otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 Easy Tips to Create More Time in Your Life</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/time-tips/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2017 11:26:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/time-tips/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being busy has became a badge of honor. For me, it‚Äôs just plain stupid. I do a lot of things but I‚Äôm not busy. In fact, one of the questions people ask me a lot is ‚ÄúHow do you find time?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, you cannot find it. It‚Äôs not a pair of sun glasses which you left at a beach. You can‚Äôt find time or lose it‚Ä¶ but you can spend it on stupid things or lasting valuable good things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give some examples of stupid thing that I &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; avoid doing and some time tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid texting with friends - just freaking call or talk in person when you want talk, and use text is only for scheduling hangouts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use activities which do not require focus like folding laundry, washing dishes or writing HTML to listen to audio books and good podcasts. That‚Äôs how I was able to &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/200-books&quot;&gt;consume over 200 books in the last three years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid reading Facebook timeline or looking at Instagram news feed. Only post, don‚Äôt consume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid checking Twitter feed and when you do only subscribe to a handful of people, no more than 200 people and look into ‚ÄúIn case you missed it‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch movie trailers instead of full movies. I only watch movies trailers in planes that‚Äôs enough to see all the good scenes and in 80% of the cases understand the plot‚Ä¶ but even that makes me want to puke either because modern movies are so brain-dead or full of loser-oriented propaganda (e.g., Hangover)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretend TV and cable do not exist and skip commercials by getting Netflix or Amazon Prime if you want some dumb entertainment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore surveys or providing feedback beyond stars or thumbs on hotels, flights, books, apps, services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid writing reviews unless I really want for my own notes/thinking as I did with &lt;a href=&quot;https://webapplog.com/managing-humans-summary/&quot;&gt;Managing Humans&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/barbell&quot;&gt;Antifragile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid being tired because when you are tired you want to take a break, a long weekend or a vacation. Don‚Äôt get tired in the first place! To do so, &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers&quot;&gt;eat property&lt;/a&gt;, exercise and have a good sleep &lt;em&gt;every night&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid reading popular magazines, Medium, blog posts, news‚Äî&lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/ignorance&quot;&gt;ignorance is a bliss&lt;/a&gt; in these cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt confuse activity with results. Being busy is not equates with achieving a lot. Observe what things are wasteful and not productive. Just the act of observing will help you to gain more time to be more productive while spending less time and being less busy and tired!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Success Formula</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/success-formula/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 May 2017 11:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I wrote that &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/success-is-boring&quot;&gt;success is boring&lt;/a&gt;. It still sounds true to me now, but I noticed a simple yet powerful formula for success. It works in almost all cases as far as I know based on dozens of biographies and autobiographies I‚Äôve read and heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success is talent plus hard work plus luck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talent is about up-brining and genes. It‚Äôs related to luck but the luck formula component itself is more about present and future than predetermined past of early childhood, country of origin, language or culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The luck in the formula could be generated by more hard work (more activity leads to more opportunity), but it‚Äôs not a guaranteed linear relationship because statistically numbers could be low for the cause and effect to play out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard work is self explanatory. More talent can require less hard work and vice versa if you are less talented you could compensate to a certain degree with hard work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So three components are related and might affect one another but as a general direction this formula clear and universal. It makes going for success in any area straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people use social media wrong. They scroll through what seems to be a never ending timeline‚Ä¶down, down, down. They come back in half an hour and scroll again to see something new. Down, down, down‚Ä¶ and when they see the posts they‚Äôve already seen earlier in the day, they switch to another app: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google +, Vine, Snapchat, WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger or Skype. When they‚Äôve checked everything they have installed and signed up for‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs time to repeat the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People check social media on their phone, but then they are on their laptops or desktop computers. It‚Äôs time to check everything &lt;strong&gt;again&lt;/strong&gt; because, you know, something new might have happened or after all, Facebook website and Facebook mobile app are so different from each other! üòè &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong, wrong, wrong. You are just consuming low quality content for a thrill of dopamine released by your novelty seeking lizard brain (&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/5895898&quot;&gt;Amygdala&lt;/a&gt;) üê≤. You are a gambling addict, a slot machine junking pulling the lever down, down, down. You are wasting time, getting full of ads, and losing your brain cycles (where the focus goes energy flows).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right usage of media about harnessing the power of social media to your benefit, here are some of the examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Message, video, chat with friends and organize in-person meetings. Connecting has never been so cheap and easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs not what you know, it‚Äôs whom you know so keep your contacts saved for future interactions (your rolodex), both business (Twitter, LinkedIn) and personal (Facebook, WhatsApp)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post valuable, useful and interesting updates. Sorry but what you ate for breakfast or what is the view form of your window does NOT count unless you are a celebrity (they are forgiven).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I check my social media accounts just once a week. I almost never look at the timeline and never for a long period of time. I &lt;em&gt;proactively&lt;/em&gt; reach out to people, search topics and hashtags, and then message and comment. I check my notifications and reply to the ones that need replies. I deleted all the social media apps from my phone and don‚Äôt miss them. It helps me to focus on important matters and act instead of reacting. üòá&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use social media to your advantage and don‚Äôt let social media consume you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Create an Online Course in Five Simple Steps</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/create-course/DeathtoStock_ModernWorkshop-04.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create an online course to learn something yourself, to promote one of your other products, to help others and to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastcompany.com/3047592/this-online-school-for-developers-pays-teachers-millions-of-dollars&quot;&gt;millions&lt;/a&gt;. Here are the five simple steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;strong&gt;pick a topic&lt;/strong&gt;. To create an online course, you are NOT required to have expertise in a topic. Although having it will speed up the process from a few weeks, or even months, to a few day, or even hours. Seriously. It took me 0 time to create my first online course on Node. I just invited a friend to record my workshop. I already knew the material. The course has close to 20,000 students now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, &lt;strong&gt;create an outline&lt;/strong&gt;. Give it to someone who is not your lover or close friend because they are &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; likely to give you an honest feedback. Even better, ask someone to pay you for the course based on the outline. It‚Äôs called MVP and pre-sales. It‚Äôs the best way to test an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, &lt;strong&gt;create slides&lt;/strong&gt;. I use Deckset but you can use Powerpoint or Keynotes. Whatever you already know or the fastest to learn. Google presentation is the best choice after Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, find a quiet place, and then &lt;strong&gt;record voice overs&lt;/strong&gt;. If you‚Äôre on macOS, then you can just use QuickTime. I use Screenflow which is just $100. You might need to re-record a few times before you get it right. It‚Äôs normal. No pressure. No one will see your failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifth, &lt;strong&gt;upload videos&lt;/strong&gt; somewhere. You can use simplistic YouTube or Vimeo, or more advanced Teachable or Thinkific. It doesn‚Äôt matter at this point too much, so don‚Äôt spend hour upon hours on research. The goal is to find at least 10 customers for your course and get their feedback. After that you can always update slides, re-record videos or change platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarize,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick a topic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an outline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create slides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record voice over videos (slides + audio)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload videos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are you waiting for? Your students &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; you. Go and create a course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: If you are interested in hearing my full story on how I transitioned from writing coding books to being an online course creator, then I wrote a book about it. Check it out. It‚Äôs called &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1IjQazP&quot;&gt;ProgWriter 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Idiocy of Open Offices</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/open-offices/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2017 11:55:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/open-offices/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/open-offices/office.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been doing software engineering for over 15 years now, and I always had to sit in an open office space. Sometimes like at FDIC or NIH, I had a short wall to form a noise barrier- sort of a cubicle. The walls are only shoulder length so they are still a galaxy away from being sound proof. Especially when the desk is in the hallway like how mine was at FDIC, or near a chatty NIH colleague who spends hours everyday talking with someone on the phone in loud Cantonese. Argh. Human voice is very distracting even when you don‚Äôt understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that set up is luxury compared to the idiocy of open offices practiced by startup and large corporations on the West Coast. There are rows upon rows of narrow tables with 50 or 100+ people in giant rooms. Tables to tables. Rows and rows. This is a 21st analog of an industrial age factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in this information age, the metrics are not tangible goods. They are harder to measure, and this is what fools senior leadership, office designers, founders and CEOs/COOs. &lt;em&gt;Activity is not ‚Äúresult‚Äù.&lt;/em&gt; Do they put everyone in the open to reduce slacking because they can‚Äôt effectively measure results? (Slack and IM are constant distractions too but that‚Äôs a different &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/flow&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;. At least you can turn them off!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fancy San Francisco unicorn ‚Äústartups‚Äù or giant Silicon Valley corporations, you can be next to a ping pong, foosball or a product manager. With &lt;strong&gt;all this noise&lt;/strong&gt; and distractions, people can‚Äôt work. They tire quickly because they go to chat with co-workers, laugh, and play another stupid game which should be banned from any office, which only adds to the noise even more. Catch 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there‚Äôs little work that can be done between 9-5pm, people come early or stay late‚Ä¶ or work from home to get at least something done. When they are in the office from 9 to 5, only shallow work gets done. Deep work is almost impossible in an open office. That, and distractions in the form of useless meetings, social media, email arguments, long lunch breaks sprinkled with lots of coffee breaks and gossiping- just anything to kill the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And no, noise cancelling headphones are not a solution because the music is a distraction itself and none of it will help from a nerf dart being shot at you (as often happened at DocuSign and was source of constant(something is missing here)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line is that open office employees become dumber&lt;/strong&gt; because all they can do is shallow work. Also some of them will become:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More negative: Social media, procrastination and late night works at home to catch up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissatisfied: Deep work is very rewarding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fatter: All the stress, and the extra snack (typically free), and coffee breaks will increase your chances of survival if you ever will be marooned on a deserted island&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies waste money because they are paying for unproductive time. Yes. Companies save on real estate, but if there are more remote workers there would be virtually zero demand for office space for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve noticed, most of my best work happens in early mornings or late evenings when I‚Äôm at alone at the office or at home and the neighbors‚Äô twin toddlers are not crying. I hate open offices. They are just a bit better than working from a cafe or an airplane. At least in a cafe you are surrounded by strangers and not obligated to talk to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-open-office-trap&quot;&gt;open office trap&lt;/a&gt;. Some escaped it by &lt;a href=&quot;https://shift.newco.co/why-i-only-work-remotely-2e5eb07ae28f#.lly2vlxxo&quot;&gt;working only remotely&lt;/a&gt;. Good for them, but for the rest of us it‚Äôs a vicious circle of frustration, stress, dissatisfaction and becoming dumber due to inability to perform at peak level and do deep work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs come up with a solution. How about having &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.signalvnoise.com/restoring-sanity-to-the-office-d9d35dd8689e#.fme2rq3i4&quot;&gt;library rule&lt;/a&gt; in an office like what BaseCamp has? No games, no nerf guns, no talking on the freaking phone (even if you‚Äôre a product manager). And the community areas and kitchens can have all the collaboration, chat and noise they want. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Michael Lopp in his top-seller book &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2kEFQ0z&quot;&gt;Managing Humans&lt;/a&gt;, which I highly recommend reading, refers to collaboration as ‚Äúa word used to convince you to work with people you‚Äôd rather avoid.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Goals Are for Losers, How to Generate Luck and to be Promoted for Being Unqualified</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/how-to-fail/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Mar 2017 13:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/how-to-fail/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I finished reading Scott Adam‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mpZLlh&quot;&gt;How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life&lt;/a&gt;. Scott is the creator of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dilbert.com&quot;&gt;Dilbert&lt;/a&gt; cartoon series. He is also a hypnotist and a master of the mindset. I highly recommend his book. Here are the three nuggets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals are for losers.&lt;/strong&gt; Use routines instead. Routines will make you have progress without constantly focusing on how far your goal is. So keep your goals but don‚Äôt obsess over them being too far. Instead build routines and system to make progress towards your goals daily or at least weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luck can be generated.&lt;/strong&gt; It‚Äôs a product of your skills. The more relevant skills you have, the better. Learning skills like public speaking, hypnosis, writing, programming, or second language (or third like I am doing right now) - all will increase your chances and luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promotion could be given for being unqualified&lt;/strong&gt;. This is how Scott was promoted in not one but two big companies. His job wasn‚Äôt what he was supposed to do but finding and interviewing for the next job. Think about it. Interviewing and day job are often two very separate things and skill sets. This is very true in tech and IT field! My own experience of frustration over tech interviewing is described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://webapplog.com/i-will-puke-if-i-hear-array-search-interview-question-again&quot;&gt;I will puke if I hear array search interview question again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott has many other gems in his book. He is also funny, but not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; funny since the book is actually on a serious topic of success, career and the proper mindset. Get your own &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2mpZLlh&quot;&gt;copy&lt;/a&gt; and read it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Find Time: Stop Finding and Start Creating It</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/time/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2017 13:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When people hear that I published 14 books and several online courses while speaking at 17 conferences in 2016 and working full time at Capital One on hands-on projects, they ask one question: ‚ÄúHow do you find time?‚Äù. Simple answer is I don‚Äôt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never lost time to find it. Every day each of us gets 24 hour. Not more and not less. Generally it‚Äôs not a lack of time but a lack of energy. Have you ever come from work and felt tired, then had dinner and vegetated on a sofa watching yet another TV show? I use this time to write books, blogs, and courses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also create time. People like to watch movies while flying. I write this blog post right now as I‚Äôm 10000s feet up in the air. People like to play games on their iPhones and Android while in a subway commuting to work (I hope not while driving!). I listen to books and podcasts to educate myself and stay on top of current technologies and events. 
People spend time looking at social media to become negative because they can‚Äôt keep up with the Jones. I get my relevant news from digests and newsletters while automating social media postings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, time is not the problem and often times you can create more time. Having enough energy is more important, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/flow&quot;&gt;flow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers&quot;&gt;paleo&lt;/a&gt; helps me with that.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flow</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/flow/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2017 12:53:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/flow/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flow is a blissful state of activity in which time is distorted and reality is ignored. Programming, writing, painting are all examples of a flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distractions kill flow. Emails, IMs, noise are examples of such flow killers. Each distraction not only robs you of your amazing flow time, but it also taxes the mental capacity to get back into the flow. So a 5-minute detour typically cost 15-20 minutes because it takes time to remember the last step, focus and remove residual thinking. That 30-minute call actually ate 1-1.5 hours because you stopped the flow 15 minutes prior the call at a stopping point so you are not in the middle and have plenty of time to dial in. Then you had to get back into the flow after the call which took at lest 15 minutes more. That‚Äôs a 3-4x increase which don‚Äôt account for. But that‚Äôs not the only problem with work fragmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;more exhaustive&lt;/em&gt; to multitask (which is a form of constant switching) than to be in the flow. Most of us had a tiresome day when we can‚Äôt name a thing we accomplished because there were meetings, calls, conversations, urgent things, emails and IMs.  I feel more tired when I try (and fail) to multitask in a meeting by checking emails or taking notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So flow feels good, it‚Äôs more productive and produces a higher quality results (&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2j3rhip&quot;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt;). Good. Then why the multitasking habit is so prevalent in our day and age? I‚Äôll blame the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the Internet is a network built on server client architecture. Clients, a.k.a. as browsers, make requests to remote servers to fetch information or to send it. There‚Äôs delay. The delay was way worse a decade ago. That‚Äôs why there are tabs in a browser. I noticed that I tend to open multiple webpages using ‚ÄúOpen in a New Tab‚Äù, then start with the first while others are loading. It was saving me minutes a decade ago but now the time saved is negligible. However, I‚Äôm distracted by jumping from the content of one task to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For programmers, compilation time is something they utilize by multitasking. So tempting to check IM messanger while my Webpack is transpiling JavaScript! Or Maven and Java for you, Java devs. &lt;strong&gt;Engineers are great of optimizing after all. They try to optimize their time too‚Ä¶ at a cost of breaking the flow.&lt;/strong&gt; They are also very curious (as noted in &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2jH6G5I&quot;&gt;Managing Humans&lt;/a&gt;) which makes them good at learning but prone to losing focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to resist to optimize the waiting time. Use the waiting time to continue to work on the same task‚Ä¶ or just sit and stare at that rotating loading icon. I despise SMS/text messages for this because you can drag a 5-minute call into a multi-day correspondence. If you send me anything other than an address, phone number, price or your SSN, I‚Äôll ignore you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add to the habit of optimizing the waiting time, there‚Äôs &lt;strong&gt;over-reliance on external resources&lt;/strong&gt; like online search, documentation, colleagues and forums. Every time you need to look up something, you risk of going down the rabbit hole, getting distracted by unrelated content. If I can write a book without a research, I can do it in a few day. (In fact, I wrote ProgWriter in a day while on a internet-less train ride from Portland, Oregon to Oakland, California.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to get all you need offline. Some email clients like Outlook allow you to switch to offline mode. The programming library APIs can be remembered after you use them a few times. Offline docs like &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; command, reading source code in &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;, or Dash app are other options. If not feasible to remember something, then just leave a TK or TODO and batch up the search for a later time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;em&gt;the third type of distraction is the distractions are the easiest to eliminate because they are external.&lt;/em&gt; Things like noise, email notifications, etc. Sitting near a ping pong table, foosball or sales team is the worst! Solution: turn do not disturb mode ON, stop working in cafes and/or office, download music without words (Spotify has music from video games), &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/emails&quot;&gt;process emails instead of checking them&lt;/a&gt;, and let people &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/email-filter&quot;&gt;know&lt;/a&gt; that you respond only once a day or even better once a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be hard to adjust at first. You might feel good about being in the flow for an hour or two. Maybe three. But then feel an urge to peek into email or news or social media. What is someone needs you? What if something important happened? Resist. It‚Äôll go away. Take a walk in the park or around the office if needed, and get back into the flow of your task. I read somewhere that&lt;strong&gt; humans can only spend two to four (2-4) hours per day in an intense focus&lt;/strong&gt;. You are a human, right? The do the important things first while your brain is still fresh and will power the strongest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I remember I was able to have a TV in the background and still work (and play) on my computer when I was younger. I am sure that I wasn‚Äôt doing as much focused and advanced work back then. My guess is that over the years of programming and meditation practice, I developed the ability to focus deeper on my work by using flow. Conclusion? &lt;em&gt;The deeper your work (which requires flow) the more sensitive and damaging the distractions are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I Don't Need Your Feedback</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/feedback/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2017 07:54:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/feedback/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was at a conference and some guy told me after a quick chat ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you my feedback on Node University‚Äù. No, I don‚Äôt need your feedback. I don‚Äôt even know if you are my target audience. üëä&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we assume all feedback is good. The more the better. Bring it on! This is especially true if you‚Äôve been feedback starved which usually means you didn‚Äôt have enough users or no one really cared. Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs put aside &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2j4Ivg7&quot;&gt;Lean Startup&lt;/a&gt;, most of feedback is garbage because the person who is giving it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a customer üí∞: They are NOT paying you money and most likely never will, therefore they are NOT your target audience. Of course, first you must have a paid product or a service. You can replace &lt;em&gt;paying&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;actively engaging&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not a majority üíØ: Minority which means you should NOT cater to their needs ‚Äî use 80/20 rule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not an expert üéì: They don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs best. It‚Äôs your job to be on the cutting-edge of innovation and bring the goodies to the user. It‚Äôs not the user‚Äôs job to know about the new stuff. (Think &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast&quot;&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.helloerik.com/no-one-said-they-wanted-faster-horses-they-wanted-less-horseshit&quot;&gt;horses&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downsides of listening to too much wrong feedback is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep&quot;&gt;a feature creep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/fashion-driven-development/&quot;&gt;fashion-driven development&lt;/a&gt; and lack of innovation. For example, most of my negative reviews on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Azat-Mardan/e/B00GM6QNI4&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are written by people who never read the books‚Äô introductions and most of them never finished reading the books either. Ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback is proliferating. Uber ride? Leave your feedback. Hotel stay? Fill out a survey. Meal in a restaurant? Comment on Yelp. Listened to a conference talk? Fill a survey. Watched an online course? Leave stars. Read a book? Write a review‚Ä¶ But we know so &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; about the background of those reviewers! Be careful who you are listening to, because you are missing on other opportunities‚Ä¶ use some feedback filter like the one I listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shaming is Good</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/shaming/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 11:44:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/shaming/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shaming is good because it‚Äôs a strong motivator to change. If you have a trouble with the word itself due to negative bias, then substitute it with &lt;em&gt;peer pressure&lt;/em&gt; or environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans as tribal creatures evolved to conform, for the most part, to our environment. It‚Äôs done via shaming. Let‚Äôs take an accent for example. Most people will adapt to the accent of their region to fit in. They do it automatically, both adults and children. Children do it faster, because there‚Äôs more shaming from other children. Thus, there‚Äôs a stronger motivator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To expand on accents, when I worked on the East Coast in the IT industry as an app developer, I was surrounded by other foreigners and native English speakers. But neither of them who would correct pronunciation or point out. The foreigners didn‚Äôt care or knew and native speaker were polite to correct such trivialities (which are not trivial at all). As a result, there was very little motivation and even awareness to not just to change an accent, but event to pronounce words correctly. It seemed like no one cared‚Ä¶ and of course adults and professionals just more tolerant and mature to laugh (form of shaming) at other adults‚Äô pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of shaming could be one of the reason why despite being dumber kids learn accents faster than adults do. The latter just &lt;em&gt;coast in their blissful ignorance once they acquire the minimum functional level&lt;/em&gt;. I‚Äôm sure you can find other examples of good shaming like switching to macOS from Windows, picking up a new programming language because PHP is not cool anymore, finding a better job or to dumping that crazy girlfriend. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaming is an important fail check that prevent individuals to fall below a certain level. Of course, too much shaming like too much of almost anything is bad‚Ä¶ however, no shaming at all can lead to no personal or career growth at all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I Learned Reading 200 Books üìö</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/200-books/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 28 Dec 2016 01:08:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/200-books/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not a huge fan of reading. In fact, I don‚Äôt like reading. But I love getting better, finding out something new and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can talk only to few interesting people in-person. The limit is in time, location or just that they won‚Äôt talk with you. Books are a transferable information. Good info can change career, life, relationships‚Ä¶ everything!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So three years ago I start reading and logging books I read or listened to in a spreadsheet. Also, I was writing number of page or hours along with brief book summaries. I reached 200 with this breakdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2014: 33 books&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2015: 67 books with 26 audio and 41 digital or print&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2016: 101 books with 75 audio and 26 in digital or print&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the audio books for 2016 amount to over 400 hours of content. That‚Äôs 50 days of 8-hour listening per day. Almost all of the books were non-fiction. So here‚Äôs what I learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books are not created equal: So books are junk or should be 50 not 350 pages because they don‚Äôt have than much substance. Most modern non-fiction books are&lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/ego-is-the-friend&quot;&gt; junk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening on 1.5x and speed reading rocks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really don‚Äôt like printed books. Kindle is a way to go!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Successful people have different rules, habits, approaches which often contradict other successful people. Thus, don‚Äôt listen to their advices. It‚Äôs not what brought them success. (&lt;em&gt;Icons and Idiots&lt;/em&gt; by Bob Lutz).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;History and biographies (especially auto biographies) tend to be the better books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eat my frogs first to get things done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Black Swans can be good and bad. To benefit from good black swans, you have to take risk and action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing books is more fun than reading books. I should write a non-technical book next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monopoly is good if you are the monopoly (&lt;em&gt;Zero to One&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wheat, bread, and GMO are evil. I knew it before but it‚Äôs good to be reminded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why steak houses make you eat in darkness (&lt;em&gt;Mindless Eating&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less is more (&lt;em&gt;The Paradox of Choice&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs more or less all. It‚Äôs extremely hard to summarize books. The way they work, is that they take you on a journey and influence your subconscious. In the end you might have new ideas or perspective without realizing it‚Äôs from a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus! My top 5 list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Antifragile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Next 100 Years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made in America&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grain Brain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Check vs. Process Emails</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/emails/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2016 08:32:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/emails/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I stopped saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm checking my email‚Äù, because I almost never check them. That‚Äôs true. I stopped checking my emails a few years ago, and &lt;strong&gt;it brought more focus, fun and productivity to my life&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of checking my emails, I process them. What is the difference? &lt;em&gt;Checking is looking at the inbox, fishing for urgent, filtering non-urgent and plain spam but answering only to urgent.&lt;/em&gt; This will make you seem like a very responsive person to senders, but most of the times they can wait a few hours or even a few days. If they are your clients or employees, then they‚Äôll learn to batch items and not treat email like an IM, or write only as the last resort &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; they took a stub at or googled a question they want to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing on the other hand is dealing with &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; emails from first to last. It‚Äôs inbox 0, but I take it to extreme. In the productivity method called Get Things Done (GTD), the author of the method recommends to respond to an email if it‚Äôs less that 2 minutes. I process an email which I estimate would take under 30 minutes &lt;em&gt;right away&lt;/em&gt;. The reason is that I don‚Äôt want to star an email or move it to my todo list. I‚Äôll be harder to come back to it. I‚Äôm already in the context by reading it, so I will benefit from not having a context switch. I take care of the email and the task right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few words about mobile email processing. Sorry, but it‚Äôs not possible in most cases. Okay, maybe your work and life is different. Maybe all you need is your brain and a few sentences of reply in most of the cases. My work and life require me to have at my disposal developer tools, writing and publishing apps, calendar, word processor, etc. Therefore, I never process emails on my phone. Yes, I still do have the app to get some useful information like a travel itinerary but that‚Äôs it. Whatever time is gained by me filtering out quick responses and dealing with them at a Starbucks line is lost by the cognitive load of task switching and open loops of myriads of unfinished tasks marked by stars, flags and (worse) unread to move it back to inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human brains are wired for novelty so we see the thrill of new urgent emails and avoid non-urgent or boring. Casinos exploit this trait in their slot machines. Email apps and slot machine even have the same motion downwards: scroll down the inbox and pull down a lever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It take longer to process emails than to check them once. However, processing is faster than checking emails over and over, and then one more time when you doing the task asked in the email. That‚Äôs what usually happens. All those unclosed loops overwhelm us. Argh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberate yourself. Start processing instead of checking. I process my personal emails only once a day or ever every other day when I‚Äôm traveling. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Barbel Theory Applied to a Career in Tech</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/barbell/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2016 12:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/barbell/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading Nassim Taleb‚Äôs great book &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2hsHHE6&quot;&gt;Antifragile&lt;/a&gt;, I saw how one can apply the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbell_strategy&quot;&gt;barbell theory&lt;/a&gt;, which he described in the book, to building a career in tech:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus 80-90% of fundamentals&lt;/strong&gt; like algorithms, data structures, specifications (W3C), standards (ECMAScript), etc.: These concepts are less prone to changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Focus 10-20% on riskier but more promising new things&lt;/em&gt; which haven‚Äôt even been discovered by early adopters let alone the early majority.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus 0 on stuff in the middle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your bet on 20% of the riskier stuff is correct, you‚Äôll be ahead of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle&quot;&gt;Rogers‚Äô bell curve&lt;/a&gt;. If not, then you are still safe with your 80% in the fundamentals. Maybe you even learned something like a special pattern which can be applied to another concept or language in the future. For example, functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my career, I followed the Barbell Theory without knowing about it. I got bachelors and masters degrees, the safest bet one can make. Then I focused on web development which is NOT very exciting but very ubiquitous and always in demand. That‚Äôs my 80%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I branched out into Node.js which was very controversial in 2011-2012. Node.js is mainstream now. Also, I started writing books which is one of the most riskier activities to do (high chance of failure).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2hXl1ZI&quot;&gt;Quitter&lt;/a&gt;, Jon Acuff starts the narrative with advice NOT to quit a job. I agree with him 150%. It‚Äôs way better and easier to take long-term riskier and more impactful bets when you have your steady base. Your 80%. I did my writing while still holding a full-time job. That‚Äôs barbell again. Moreover, teaching in-person and online, working full-time job, and writing fed one of another. Writing and teaching made me a better developer and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So start a project on a weekend. Pick up a new language and read learn it over the holidays. If there‚Äôs a book on the language or framework‚Äîit‚Äôs too late. IGNORE the stuff in the middle. Ignore the noise, but know about the trends, and see a big one you can jump on while still standing on a solid ground. That‚Äôs the barbell theory in action.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Escapism: Stop Wasting Time and Distracting Yourself with Traveling</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/escapism/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2016 19:32:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/escapism/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of people are brainwashed into spending their hard-earned money into enduring stresses of traveling and adjusting to new places for subpar experiences. They even say: Work hard, play hard. Why?! Because resorts need to make &lt;strong&gt;money&lt;/strong&gt;. Seriously, most people prefer the escapism and procrastination. Is it really worth it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs be honest, if you are a tourist, it‚Äôs harder to find good (price/value) food, gym, entertainment comparing to when you are local. There are even guide on how to travel like a local because traveling like a tourist gives people subpar and overpriced experiences. Also, traveling is a dangerous, time consuming stressful hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You waste time waiting in lines and for transportation (procrastination!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You risk germs, terrorist attacks, malfunctions, criminals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You spend more on worst food/lodging/etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have to use slower internet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You risk comparing and keeping up with the Joneses (distractions!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel for business is okay, but only if any other means like Skype won‚Äôt cut it. Most of the times, video and voice calls will do it! Think clearly if this urge is an urge to escape the difficulties instead of facing them. Procrastinating instead of solving problems. If you need some rest, then consider a staycation‚Äîyou won‚Äôt need to pay extra and risk a bad experience. You can find more piece and calm closer to you. Maybe go to a spa or on a hike. No need to fly to Cancun or Las Vegas and end up even more tired.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Liking to Travel and Enjoying the Journey is Stupid</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every time someone says: ‚ÄúI like traveling‚Äù, I know they are lying. Typically these people don‚Äôt travel much, or they foolishly think living in a foreign country for more than few weeks is traveling (hint: it‚Äôs called living in a country, if you stay there more than 3-4 weeks)‚Ä¶ or they are plain simple masochists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúEnjoy the journey, not the destination‚Äù is a bunch of crap. &lt;em&gt;People who say enjoy the journey and the destination are CONFUSED&lt;/em&gt;. I want the destination. I like the destination. I need the destination. I like to have a walk the streets of Paris, or a cup of coffee in Plaza Vieja in Habana, or soak in blue lagoon in Reykjavik or eat pig knuckle in Prague. Why should I enjoy the commute to the airport, going thru security lines, sitting in closed spaced with stranger and all other troubles of traveling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let‚Äôs call things properly. Traveling is not being at a place and experiencing good things. Screw the journey. Enjoy the destination!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Small Stuff</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you worried about small stuff and losing the big picture? Some people worry about whether they should cut down on coffee, walk more, eat less carbs, get more Starbucks reward and credit card miles, watch the latest TV show, or who said what on social media. All this B.S. Just thinking about these things makes me tired. Most of the time they worry about small stuff. That‚Äôs a great way to lose focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do they do it? To stay in the comfortable, but average mediocrity. To procrastinate. To avoid doing the big scary stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep your eyes on the big goal. Put reminders everywhere. Stay laser focused. &lt;em&gt;Do the most important scary thing first in the day, and the small stuff won‚Äôt matter that much.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Fight Perfectionism</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/perfectionism/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2016 13:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/perfectionism/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most of us &lt;em&gt;intuitively&lt;/em&gt; understand that better products and services is better for you as an employee or business owner. They can attract more customers and propel you to success, whatever that is for you. Some of us know the inspiring stories of obsessed entrepreneurs who drove the product to perfection amidst delays and budget overruns (e.g., Steve Jobs). Common sense tells us that the less flaws there is, the better. It could be due to our experience as a consumer of goods. It could be because we learned it in schools where we avoided errors in our homework and tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, things are not as easy in life and business as in school. On the other side of the spectrum is the analysis paralysis and procrastination, never published manuscripts and never deployed code. &lt;em&gt;Sometimes it pays off to do half-baked experiments and fail once in a while&lt;/em&gt;. There‚Äôs a whole methodology around it called Lean Startups. Unfortunately, almost none of us hear about myriads of other entrepreneurs who didn‚Äôt make it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There‚Äôs time to polish and improve, and there‚Äôs time to call it‚Äôs done even when it‚Äôs not perfect.&lt;/em&gt; After all, &lt;strong&gt;done is better than perfect undone&lt;/strong&gt;. Here‚Äôs a quick list of things you can do to fight perfectionism:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take more projects: This will force you to finish the current projects faster. Commit and then decide how to deliver!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set deadlines and share them with &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; people like clients, bosses, co-workers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt sleep enough for three nights or work at nights: I noticed that my perfectionism goes down when I am tired and just want to finish a project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outsource: Hiring is like buying time. It‚Äôs like cheat codes in video games only it‚Äôs better for everyone (you, your client and the person you are hiring)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember your WHYs: Why are you doing this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divide products and features into two categories: incremental improvement (perfectionism is the key) and ground-breaking (first-to-release is the key).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making a better widget is fulfilling which in turn is important. But when you do so beyond a reason, ask yourself a question: Am I afraid of success? Is this a self-sabotage? Procrastination? If yes, then kill the perfectionism excuse and finish the project. In this case, perfection is a burden and an obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ego is the Friend: Review on Ego Is the Enemy</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/ego-is-the-friend/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2016 13:30:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/ego-is-the-friend/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent Ryan‚Äôs book is another popular junk-read which have 0 substance and not only waste time but actually distract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the title of another popular junk-read &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2ecGUmr&quot;&gt;Ego Is the Enemy&lt;/a&gt;, I should say that ego is the friend if you want to change or achieve anything in life. Every time you think I‚Äôm a good software developer you will have to back it up with action. If you decide to lose weight, it‚Äôs far more useful to say to yourself ‚Äúevery day in every way, I‚Äôm getting leaner and healthier‚Äù than to stick to your old ego of a person who has bad genes, heavy bones or stress full life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples in the book are terrible. They are not accurate and distorted to support the author‚Äôs point of view. His choice to consider two Union generals and 0 Confederate generals while most historians agree that Confederates had better generals is biased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of all, the author never proves that ego is bad or is the enemy. He tell anecdotes without any studies. Why a person became successful? It could be because he identified himself with success and had big ego. Yes, maybe he failed later because he stopped delivering great results but that doesn‚Äôt support the hypothesis that ego is bad. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation&quot;&gt;Correlation does not equal causation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: avoid this book.. and maybe this &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2evHobx&quot;&gt;one as well&lt;/a&gt; and all other Tim Ferriss related junk-reads.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bad Long Weekends: 6-Day Workweek Manifesto</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/weekends/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2016 03:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/weekends/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/proxy/1*Tdu6SILy42fjbx5pO3YgVw.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Weekend Office&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weekends are too long‚Ä¶ waaaay too loooong. Two full days! We should switch to 6-day workweeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think I‚Äôm crazy, because recently some companies started to experiment with &lt;em&gt;4-day workweeks instead of normal 5&lt;/em&gt;, not 6. Even some countries toyed with the idea to make it a law. Also, books like 4-hour Workweek became the best seller because people want to work less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah, yeah. Believe me. I thought it all through. People need to work more, not less to achieve satisfaction. We need more workdays. Here are my reasons to work 6 days (if not for the entire country then just for you):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Same total number of hours: People can spend in deep work only up to 4 hours per day. So leave earlier than typical 5pm during the week, hit the gym, and come to work on Saturday. And according to studies, people on average actually work only 4 hours anyway. The rest is Facebook, chatting with co-workers and breaks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased productivity: Open office is a detriment to productivity. You are less distracted on Saturdays so you can get more done. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased income: If you don‚Äôt work then you are more likely to spend money on ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù or entertainment such as eating out, trips, shopping, etc. This is a double whammy because you are not just spending more but you are earning less. For example, your weekend getaway didn‚Äôt cost $400 for hotel and $200 for food, but $1,400 ($600 PLUS $800 which you could have made during the leisure time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased satisfaction: You can get ahead on your projects faster be it for work or side gigs. It will create momentum, motivation and move you ahead even faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increased learning: After two days of not working on a thing I often forget what I needed to do. Loss of context is waste. By working on a project everyday I can stay focused. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bible says so: Even if you are not a religious person, you can learn a thing or two from a 2000-year best seller which says to rest only ONE day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Litmus test for a job change: If you can‚Äôt make yourself think of working on your primary job for one extra day per week. If just think about it makes you wanna puke back your organic smoothie, then maybe it‚Äôs time to find yourself a better one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been working 6 days per week on either my main full time job, side-projects or taking classes for more than a decade. I feel weird if I have to take two days off in a week. There‚Äôs nothing to do by the second day. All the rest is done. All the errands are done. You start coming up with stupid activities like ‚ÄúOh, let‚Äôs go to the beach!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI should buy a motorcycle!‚Äù‚Ä¶ which most of the time only make you exhausted by Monday instead of helping you to recharge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researched proved that human brains relax when they switch tasks not when they have nothing to do. Replenish your energy by switching tasks and picking a creative side-project in which you have a lot of control like building your own app or contributing to open source. My thing is writing books and recording video courses. Also, Saturdays are great for reading, learning, thinking, reflecting, goal setting and budgeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many benefits, working 6 days per week is a non-brainer. Be smart and work hard at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Email Filter</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/email-filter/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Sep 2016 22:30:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/email-filter/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2cbhiJv&quot;&gt;Deep Work&lt;/a&gt;, I was sold on removing distractions. One of the concept is to have an email filter. Not an automatic one but some set of criteria which will force the sender to think and put more work into their emails. Here‚Äôs what I came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filters which your email must adhere to increase chances of my reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No questions which you can find on Google/Bing/GoGoDuck under 10 min. If you still have a question, post it in a public forum and include a link so others can benefit from the answer too&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Don't Move to San Francisco or 7 Reasons Why You Should Avoid Living in the Bay Area</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/not-sf/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/not-sf/I_hate_this_city____sanfrancisco__sanfran__sf__california.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;San Francisco, CA&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lived fro 5 years in the Bay Area which is San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, and everything in between them (a.k.a. Silicon Valley). Before that I lived in Washington DC for 6 year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt confuse tourism with immigration if you‚Äôve been in the Bay Area on a brief vacation and liked it. Despite what you‚Äôve seen in movies, San Francisco and Silicon Valley are terrible places to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously. Avoid moving to San Francisco and Silicon Valley because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will never be able to afford your own place&lt;/strong&gt;: Forget about owning your own house unless you‚Äôre super rich tech millionaire (which you won‚Äôt become); and large chunk of your pay check will go to the landlord because of the ridiculous laws prohibiting more housing and scaring off owners from renting out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will have to work insane hours&lt;/strong&gt; in an open-space office filled with extremely loud co-workers and stupid super noisy toys while being assaulted by dogs üêï and shot at with nerf guns‚Ä¶ needless to say your productivity will be close to 0, and you‚Äôll have to catch up after hours and come to work early. Startups had to use the open-office layout because they wanted to save money. Big companies blindly copied it without thinking to ‚Äúfoster‚Äù communication and create innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You won‚Äôt become a millionaire&lt;/strong&gt; creating a startup, because your startup will burn through VC money faster than in any other place: Raising money is easy, but spending it on expensive engineers and office is easier. If you manage to partner or hire someone, expect them to leave for greener pastures in 1 year max.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You be SINGLE and lack in true friendship&lt;/strong&gt;: Friendship and dating are not just hard, they are almost impossible, because you are surrounded with smart ambitious driven overachiever transplants who can‚Äôt find time to FaceTime let alone meet (because they are overworked due to poor office environment?); and if you‚Äôre already married holding on to your spouse will be hard (see 2 and 6)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will get hot a lot&lt;/strong&gt;, because typically there is NO air conditioning in buildings. Yes. it‚Äôs 2016 and no A/Cs. ‚òÄÔ∏è Also, the all-year-round climate with drought will bore and make you long for winter or rain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will feel inferior most of the times&lt;/strong&gt;: You always be surrounded with people smarter, luckier, more hard-working and more successful people than yourself: If you have a bit of an inferiority complex from time to time, here it will be multiplied by 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will start hating driving&lt;/strong&gt; because why bother? Streets of San Francisco, 101, I-80, Bay Bridge, any bridge‚Ä¶ everything is backed up pretty much all the time. üö¶ Public transportation sucks. It‚Äôs filthy, slow and full of crazies. This leads to problem number 4 because keeping up with people will be harder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So give all these points, any reasonable human being who wants to remain sane and productive should avoid San Francisco and the Bay Area and live some where else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: This post has sarcasm, but also has some true points.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Text is Awesome üìù</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/text/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27  Aug 2016 11:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/text/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/text/harvard-coop.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Harvard Coop&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite voice and video communication becoming cheap, ubiquitous and more popular (VoIP, Skype, FaceTime, WhatsApp, Viber, etc.), this increase create only more and more text communication. Text is so inferior in term of conveying emotions, intonation, and body language to video or even voice. Right? Then why don‚Äôt drop it or at least use less and call, FaceTime, Skype each other? Asynchronicity is one thing, but you can do voice and video asynchronously too, just record and send it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think text is awesome and will become even more popular exactly because of the thing than makes it terrible&lt;/strong&gt;, that‚Äôs desensitization‚Äîstripping emotions, body language, character, accent, mood, and other things humans grasp on conscious and subconscious levels. In other words, the same things which are beneficial for better understanding could also be distractions. What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate my point, when someone is reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://reactquickly.co&quot;&gt;a book on React&lt;/a&gt; they don‚Äôt want to be distracted away from an already comprehensive material. Also, text is more precise meaning if it says ‚Äú221 Main St‚Äù, ‚ÄúcreateElement()‚Äù or ‚Äú8pm‚Äù you know that for sure. More over, text is easier to go back to refer to than video or voice with their tiny imprecise sliders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, you can hide a bad mood, a dislike or a passive-aggressive behavior behind text. (I‚Äôm not saying that passive-aggressive behavior is good though.) Thus, text leaves more to imagination of a reader which makes the experience more customized and more personal. For example, I hated listening to a fake-accented &lt;em&gt;For Whom the Bell Tolls&lt;/em&gt;; I just despise when narrators think they must mimic all the accents and change pronunciation‚Äîjust get out of the way a narrator, please get lost‚Ä¶ become invisible. I don‚Äôt want anything between my experience and the book. Same things happen if I watch YouTube videos where I start noticing the quality, background, hair style, lighting and many other things which distract me from comprehending the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as messengers, I‚Äôve noticed that when you just text with someone and never talk, you have a different mental image of that person. If you ever meet or talk with that person it can feel like being with a stranger. :) Or maybe a lot of people are self-conscious and camera-shy while others don‚Äôt like the sound of their own voice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as creation, an added benefit of writing is that it forces you to think better. You see, when I started writing this post, I had only an idea, but now there are a few a few arguments and a better formed opinion. You can go back edit, review and edit again while with voice and video you‚Äôd have to re-record the entire clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line, text is not going away. In fact it‚Äôs becoming more popular way of communicating despite the fact that internet speed and data plans allow for video and voice messages. Knowing that, it‚Äôs crucial to be as effective as possible (and then some more) at your written communication: emails, social media, messengers, blogging, books, and reports. For these reasons, it‚Äôs true to say that &lt;strong&gt;writing is probably the most important skill in life and career&lt;/strong&gt;. Learn how to communicate better via text, practice and use text medium to your advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stop Reading Biographies</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/bios/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27  Aug 2016 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/bios/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished listening to another &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2b99qVA&quot;&gt;biography&lt;/a&gt;. It was one of those 30-hour monsters! A typical audio book is 6-8 hours. Why these authors think more is better. No, no and no. In most cases they are wrong, because they end up filling the pages with unnecessary facts and speculations. For example, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2b99qVA&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, author quotes his sources like its a freaking science book: with page numbers! Do I really care what in exactly what month each Disney movie was released and all the details of its production? NO! üö´&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far I listened to three of them and all three of them despite high reviews (herd mentality?) are terrible, boring (even at 1.5x) and full of uncertainties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2blUtjM&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2bHjI1V&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2b99qVA&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About uncertainties‚Äîthat‚Äôs my other beef with biographies. Why do authors have a need to psychoanalyze the hero? Just list the facts and move on. Why they feel the urge to present multiple accounts? Pick one side and tell a story. Humans love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, they try to stay neutral. Authors need to have an opinion. It‚Äôs like talking to someone. That someone needs to have an opinion. Without authors having filters, it‚Äôs just a boring text book. Well, judging by the length they are textbooks! üìö&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note to myself: &lt;strong&gt;stop ‚Äúreading‚Äù biographies&lt;/strong&gt;. They are waste of time! &lt;em&gt;Start reading and listening more to autobiographies instead&lt;/em&gt;. They are livelier, full of opinions which makes them congruent and just overall have better story lines sans boring facts‚Ä¶ and they are shorter because interesting successful people understand that they shouldn‚Äôt waste other people‚Äôs time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: I‚Äôm getting close to my new goal of 100 books per year with just 35 to go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Pay a Full Price</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/full-price/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10  Aug 2016 11:23:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/full-price/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let me share a little secret. üòâ  While it‚Äôs nice to get a discount and save a few bucks, especially when you‚Äôre going to buy a thing anyway, there is something magical in when you pay a full price. You‚Äôll tend to enjoy the thing more, feel better about yourself and use the thing more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies show that this phenomenon of getting benefits of paying the full price (or a premium) is even more applicable to buying something special, something experiential such as an online course, a music CD (which see only at Whole Foods and Starbucks checkout lines), or an event like a seminar or a conference. How many online courses or books did you buy on at a discount and never finished them? üìñ I bet way, way more than the ones for which you‚Äôve paid a full price (and a high one)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human brains are wired to appreciate according to the price you‚Äôve paid so buy torrenting a book or a movie or buy looking for coupons to your favorite artists‚Äô or speaker‚Äôs performance‚Äîyou are robbing yourself from a pleasure. It took me a while to realize it, but once I did üí°, I started buying music on iTunes and now subscribe to Spotify as a way to appreciate and give back to my favorite artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With commodities, which are all the same, you can get the same sweet potato chips from any website which sells them, so buying the cheapest and most convenient is less damaging to the pleasure (but still is).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs why luxury industry exists. The quality of a Gucci bag is not 100 times better. It‚Äôs roughly the same. The bonus is in the enjoyment. This principle applies to non-monetary payment, for example when working on a book or a PhD‚Äîthat‚Äôs hard and painful sometimes. However, most people treasure the results and outcomes more after a tougher journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So either pay a full price or pretend that you did (and then forget that you pretended), because you‚Äôll get more usage of whatever that thing is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Paradoxes</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/paradoxes/</link>

      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/paradoxes/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve noticed that there are a lot of paradoxes when it comes to attitudes and life which you can‚Äôt easily solve:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on doing vs. learning and expanding your horizons: You need to keep up with the latest stuff, meet new people and generate new ideas by exploring new things but you need to focus on the tasks at hand to see them through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patience vs. obsession (hard work): You need to give enough time for something great to materialize (10,000 hours, over night success which takes 10 years, etc.), but at the same time when you work hard and obsess, that‚Äôs when you see more short-term results and build momentum. Marathon or a sprint?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence vs. humility (being open to being wrong and feedback): You must be confident to overcome obstacles, yet at the same time it‚Äôs important to be receptive to feedback and improve on/learn from on your mistakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to opportunities vs. saying ‚Äúyes to them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing vs. adapting: Sometimes it‚Äôs good to change your provider, environment, equipment, etc., while other times, you just have to suck it up and not worry about mundane things which might annoy you otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on weekends and have no vacations vs. taking time off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay in one place vs. living a digital nomad life: Staying in one place are more comfortable and allows to establish connections and network (it‚Äôs who you know, not what you know most of the times even in tech); while traveling allows to expand horizon, and explore new opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being analytics vs. artistic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being good with tech&amp;amp;numbers vs. being good with people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing is to be doing both of these extremes, but they are extremes for a reason. How to be humble yet confident? Or how to stay and build connections and reputation in one area but bring new ideas from other spheres of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The million dollar question is how do you tell the difference when to pick what option? Maybe you need to take it to extremes to know your limit and that will eventually allow you to find balances easier? To put it differently, &lt;strong&gt;wisdom to remove paradoxes or act on both of their extremes harmoniously comes with practice and time&lt;/strong&gt;. Or is there a magic formula with criteria to follow?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Listening to Customers is Bad?</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/customers/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jul 2016 08:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/customers/working-in-starbucks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often hear that we need to listen to our customers/users from business, marketing and product development gurus. A popular Lean Startup methodology teaches to make as many experiments to learn about customers, their needs and wants. Zig Ziglar, Jim Rohn and Tony Robbins said something along the lines of: if you help enough people, you can achieve anything. Everyone seems to be crazy about customer satisfaction. Do we live in a tyranny of a customer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I‚Äôm re-writing my new book React Quickly, there are some concepts I don‚Äôt agree with. However, the book reviewers told me they want the book to cover certain things, so here I am, catering to my customer. What is the majority is not right? What if there‚Äôs something morally or ethically wrong with the thing that the majority of customers want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, there are plenty examples when majority, and democracy in particular, made wrong decisions. So does it make people who like to create a great product, company or business also morally or ethically wrong in the long run, just because they listened to their customers with their wrong ideas and they knew the ideas were wrong? Something to think about. Maybe the perfect approach is to know what your customers want, but give them what they need (and what‚Äôs right).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Consistency over Peaks</title>

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I would consider myself a person who likes to do things in a batch by focusing on one thing and see it through completion. For example, implementing a feature in an app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are certain tasks which you simply cannot finish in a few days, like writing a book, building strength in your body or learning a new language. It‚Äôs better to turn the work on those things into habits. Just do a little bit every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that instead of results which are often fluctuate in time (e.g., writing 500 words everyday), it‚Äôs better to block time, let‚Äôs say one hour on my new book and 30 minutes on learning Spanish &lt;strong&gt;everyday, even weekends and vacations&lt;/strong&gt;.  After a few days those activities becomes not very dissimilar to brushing your teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can accomplish a lot by doing small and simple things every day. I started with doing 10 push-ups and 20 sits up every morning a year ago. Now, I‚Äôm on to doing 100 sit ups and 50 push ups effortlessly. Chunk down your large projects and be consistent in the execution!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Newbie Forever</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/newbie-forever/Right_before_starting_my_presentation_about_Node_Patterns_From_Callbacks_to_Observer_at__NodePDX__Software__Technology__WebDevelopment__Java__JavaScript__Python__Ruby__Node.js__Angular__React.js__iOS__BigData__FinTech__Startups__Tech__code__program__.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Right before starting my presentation about Node Patterns: From Callbacks to Observer at NodePDX 2016&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a note to myself: the more I can be comfortable being newbie the more I can keep up the pace with current events, tech and apps. The reason being, it‚Äôs not enough to master one tech or app and assume it won‚Äôt change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the popularity of SaaS and web apps, they are constantly updated without us even asking us! You can forget about an app and comeback to it six month later‚Äîit‚Äôll could be a &lt;strong&gt;completely&lt;/strong&gt; new app. You‚Äôll have to learn where all the menus and buttons all over again. Learn to love it. Future apps will update even faster. Same happens with open source and programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the more you stay behind the worse the pain of an upgrade later. There is no way around it. Just &lt;em&gt;embrace being newbie forever, because the faster you learn the more comfortable you‚Äôll be in using the recent tech&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Learning fast is your competitive advantage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you can‚Äôt keep re-learning all the things continuously, that‚Äôs why focusing on a specific area is paramount. Therefore, focus, learn, re-learn and don‚Äôt afraid to be a newbie because being newbie is and will be our normal state. Being newbie is forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People tend to think that someone is shy just because he/she is not talking to anyone or not going to social events‚Ä¶ Although this might be true, I came to the conclusion that there is another reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just want to &lt;strong&gt;do things&lt;/strong&gt; instead of talking. While some conversations are insightful. For example, talking with your colleagues or customers is paramount for maintaining good communication. Other social chat is not just boring but mostly a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I‚Äôm not shy. I‚Äôm just biased towards taking action instead of useless talking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PaleoFX 2016</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/paleofx-2016/panel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;PaleoFX 2016 Panel: Paleo is growing bigger and business helps it&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote before about how &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/paleo-superpowers&quot;&gt;being on a paleo lifestyle is like having superpowers&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, I was lucky to attend PaleoFX, the biggest Paleo conference. It was kind of surreal to be around thousands of like-minded people, to see in-person almost all famous New York Times #1 Best-Sellers paleolebrities, and to be surrounded with all kinds of safe paleo-friendly food&amp;amp;drinks. Here are some of the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paleo business is growing: There were all kind of paleo flours, sweets, bars, powders, broths, fats and coffee infused with just about anything (butter, coconut, even mushrooms!).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paleolebrities are regular people: most of them hang out at the expo or after giving their presentations to answer questions. I took a picture with Robb Wolf with who‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1t8KS6J&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; my paleo journey started 6 years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were insane number of healthy and fit looking people doing workout workshops (inspiring) as well as &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; looking people (making it less intimidating).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bone broth is liquid gold: I knew that broth is healing but after listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1VDS2dY&quot;&gt;Dr. Kellyann&lt;/a&gt; I decided to become disciplined about drinking 2 cups of bone broth. Her protocol is bone broth for 21 days and fast 1-2 days per week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/paleo16&quot;&gt;Ben Greenfield‚Äôs presentation&lt;/a&gt; was full of bio hacks to increase cognitive performance like jaw realignment, morning brain flush, infra-red saunas, yoga, low intensity PEMF and others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our gut bacteria has more DNA material than we: &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1VDS2uC&quot;&gt;Dr. Perlmutter&lt;/a&gt; gave a great presentation reinforcing the importance of our gut biome. One of the analogies stuck with me: we uploaded our DNA/genes to the cloud which is our gut bacteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of sleep is aging and killing you faster: Just one night of sleep deprivation increases aging 10-15 years (temporarily) and decreases cognitive functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs harder to legally sell raw milk than marijuana (in some cases).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BF_4shkiXN9/?taken-by=azat_co&quot;&gt;A lot of science is not reliable&lt;/a&gt;, because studies to replicate findings and peer reviews are disincentivized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a great event to reinforce familiar, and learn new things about paleo lifestyle. I also got a lot of contacts for paleo-friendly web stores, products and services which will make my life on the paleo lifestyle even easier than before!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Fisherman and the Businessman B.S.</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/fisherman-and-businessman/</link>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/fisherman-and-businessman/fish.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the preamble about &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulocoelhoblog.com/2015/09/04/the-fisherman-and-the-businessman&quot;&gt;the fisherman and the businessman&lt;/a&gt;? It‚Äôs often told in a feel-good blogs and talks. The fisherman‚Äôs nationality varies from Brazilian to Mexican, but the gist is that you don‚Äôt have to strive for success and achievement. If all you want to do if is to fish and go home early, then you can start doing it now (fisherman). In other words, if your goal is to relax after you‚Äôve made money (businessman), then why not skip making money part and relax now ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it‚Äôs utterly &lt;strong&gt;bullshit&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äîand potentially dangerous for those who take its advice seriously‚Äîfor three reasons. The first is simple: the story don‚Äôt take into consideration &lt;em&gt;risks&lt;/em&gt;. Let‚Äôs say your family member gets sick. If you have the money, you can send him/her to a good hospital. This is not an option for a poor fisherman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason is the experience, adventure, the thrill and &lt;em&gt;satisfaction&lt;/em&gt; of making money, doing well in your craft (fishing and business management), career or business. This is the reward in itself for most people in the world of business. Think of it as the journey which will make you a better person. If all you do is fish, go home early and relax, then you are not challenging yourself enough. You‚Äôre not growing in your craft or skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last reason is that if you just fish for your family, then you deprive other of the fruits of your labor. If you‚Äôre any good (and with practice and time you should become good at pretty much any trade), then you‚Äôll be depriving others, e.g., people in a seafood market, of your fish. So staying at your current level and not taking it bigger is stealing from society. &lt;strong&gt;It‚Äôs selfish&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt believe all the stupid stories you read or hear from the so called gurus of life. Think for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Success is Boring</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/success-is-boring/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/success-is-boring/success-is-boring.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is what we crave. Parents, peers and culture pushes success down our throats as it‚Äôs the best thing ever. Yet not many people claim success in their lives. They jump from one hot opportunity to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day they are building SaaS, the next month consulting, and then selling cheap privately labeled and growth-hacked shit on Amazon.com. It‚Äôs like an addiction. Starting a business is easy. Starting micro businesses like SaaS, info product or private label is extremely easier than managing brick and mortar. &lt;em&gt;Entrepreneur become parallel entrepreneur.&lt;/em&gt; They juggle multiple things. Each is moderately successful, but nothing great‚Ä¶ why? Because success is boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some people like the thrill more than success.&lt;/strong&gt; Like many thrill seekers they deny this fact. They sabotage their success. They are like gamblers who hit the slot machines and frustrated by the interrupted flow of their trance when they actually do win. The adrenaline junkies, those people love to start new venture and see them succeed from 0 to 60, but they never stay long enough to see any really great fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people like the inviting adventure of new projects more than the steady long-term progress of established ones. If you need some serendipity, then go pick up a new sport (surfing, rock climbing, Krav Maga) or learn how to ride a motorcycle, but don‚Äôt bet your career on a risky proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote this post mostly for myself to stay focused and as a reminder that &lt;strong&gt;real success is boring&lt;/strong&gt;. Find the thing you‚Äôre great at and which is in demand and valued by others. Then, you stick with it unless you fully get its potential. It might be 5, 10 or 15 years. Give it a time. &lt;em&gt;Everything great takes time&lt;/em&gt;; otherwise we won‚Äôt treasure it much. Boring is good. You have my permission to be boring‚Ä¶ and achieve the success you want be it personal life, health or business.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pursuit of Happiness as The Major Source of Unhappiness or Why Happiness is Overrated</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/happiness/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2015 12:05:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/happiness/cactus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more I think about happiness, the more I come to the conclusion that it‚Äôs overrated. Maybe it‚Äôs even detrimental to actually living a productive and healthy live. You see, evolutionary &lt;strong&gt;humans weren‚Äôt designed to be happy all the time&lt;/strong&gt;. For example, you‚Äôre having a great day, maybe you made progress on a project, then you have think what would make you happy and boom‚Äîthe mood goes down if you don‚Äôt get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is simply not wired into our brains and nervous system by millions of years of evolution. &lt;strong&gt;Humans were designed to survive&lt;/strong&gt;, and survival doesn‚Äôt mean happiness. Survival is at the bottom of the Maslow‚Äôs pyramid, and it‚Äôs what our oldest brain is doing perfectly. Why work hard trying to achieve something you‚Äôre doing sub-optimally?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower expectations bring more satisfaction, right? Once I realized that we weren‚Äôt born to be happy, I had an epiphany which liberated me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forget about this illusive happiness. In the never-ending pursuit of it, you‚Äôll remain miserable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop thinking that you‚Äôre supposed to be happy all the time. Banish the entitled to feel good or thoughts on how to achieve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just live in the moment, survive and be productive, instead of worrying about illusive feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop pursuing happiness; search meaning in your life instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You only live once, but not in the context of how most people think about this phrase such as: party, drink, reward or entertain yourself. In other words, they justify some epicurean activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, I use YOLO when I‚Äôm deciding to take on new projects, work, or tasks. My mindset is to create as many useful things as possible. Time is the only finite resource that we, humans, have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don‚Äôt postpone any longer something you wanted to do yesterday or last year. Time will pass anyway‚Ä¶ So don‚Äôt spend your time on frivolous activities. Make your time count big time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Be ignorant about everything except two or three things you are really interested about. Those things are your priorities and dream goals. Everything else is a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The myth that we can do everything, should know about a variety of subjects and accomplish everything is just a myth. &lt;strong&gt;You cannot be everywhere and do everything‚Ä¶&lt;/strong&gt; If you try, the outcome is mediocrity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free&amp;Easy Hosting</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/github-pages/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2015 15:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/github-pages/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tech advice: if you need a simple website for your project, then use &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt;. It‚Äôs free and better than cheap $4.99/mo hosting, which can be easily hacked, is slow and requires you to use cPanel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need to get your website up and running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create account on GitHub (do it once).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send your developer a link to that repository, and a Twitter Bootstrap theme of your choice (Google it if you don‚Äôt know where to get a beatiful theme).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point your CNAME records in Godaddy, or whatever you‚Äôre using, to GitHub IPs (192.30.252.153 and 192.30.252.154).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Merge pull request from you developer on GitHub.com.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boom! You‚Äôve got your website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use this technique for my 10+ websites, some of them quite fancy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://rpjs.co&quot;&gt;http://rpjs.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://150x.co&quot;&gt;http://150x.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co&quot;&gt;http://azat.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://proexpressjs.com&quot;&gt;http://proexpressjs.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://expressjsguide.com&quot;&gt;http://expressjsguide.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog&quot;&gt;http://azat.co/blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://nodeprogram.com&quot;&gt;http://nodeprogram.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs no need for WordPress or PHP. GitHub Pages is free and it is faster than BlueHost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site must be static only without any PHP, Node.js or any other server-side logic. You can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxyform.com&quot;&gt;foxyform&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.emailmeform.com&quot;&gt;EmailMeForm&lt;/a&gt; for contact forms, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://gumroad.com&quot;&gt;Gumroad&lt;/a&gt; for sales. For blogs, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://wintersmith.io&quot;&gt;Wintersmith&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the famous TV show Man vs. Food, I went on a 7-day BBQ challenge. &lt;em&gt;Please don‚Äôt try this at home&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://azat.co/images/blog/10611050_340871606075312_1200209688_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Just kidding! I lasted only three days, because apparently cole slaw and sweet potato fries weren‚Äôt enough veggie for me. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All Restaurants Are Bad</title>
      <link>http://azat.co/blog/all-restaurants-are-bad/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05  Aug 2014 15:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/all-restaurants-are-bad/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We love to go out and treat ourselves to nice meals! But it‚Äôs unhealty, because almost all US restaurants are bad for you in &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/blog/fast-food-paleo-style&quot;&gt;the long run&lt;/a&gt;. Why? This is a common sense and it has to do with us when we favor cheaper places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for restaurants to stay in business they need to generate profits and cut costs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would a restaurant use more expensive extra virgin olive or coconut oil instead of cheap vegetable (mutant) oils like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marksdailyapple.com/dear-mark-canola-oil&quot;&gt;Canola&lt;/a&gt;? No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would they use more expensive wild caught fish (especially salmon in sushi places) instead of antibiotic-filled farm-raised one? No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would they use more expensive organic vegetables and fruits instead of conventional ones? No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would they use more expensive organic grass-fed meat and poultry instead of conventional grain-fed one? No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, when we vote with our dollars, we shouldn‚Äôt just choose cheaper places. If we continue doing it, organic good food will never become mainstream and cheap. Same thing happened with high-speed airlines: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde&quot;&gt;Concorde&lt;/a&gt; became extinct because passengers preferred cheaper but slower flying options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if it‚Äôs too expensive to eat at a good place like &lt;a href=&quot;http://laughingplanetcafe.com&quot;&gt;Laughing Planet&lt;/a&gt;? Just cook at home! :-)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Paleo is Like Having Superpowers</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years of being on a paleo lifestyle, I‚Äôve noticed that I don‚Äôt want to go back to the S.A.D (Standard American Diet), for the reason that living on paleo feel is akin to &lt;strong&gt;having superpowers&lt;/strong&gt;. I just don‚Äôt want to give up these perks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don‚Äôt get food coma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don‚Äôt crave sugary treats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don‚Äôt get cold or flu&lt;/strong&gt; as often (this year I took zero sick days!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have more energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can skip meals (when I travel or for fasting) and don‚Äôt feel bad, exhausted or anxious&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I spend less time shopping because a lot of food options eliminated (cereals, breads, cakes, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have &lt;strong&gt;more free time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why someone wouldn‚Äôt want to be a real-life action hero?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fast Food Paleo Style</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, we are on the go, have to travel or just want to indulge in the staple of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_American_Diet&quot;&gt;standard American diet&lt;/a&gt; (SAD) ‚Äî fast food. Personally, I find most fast food restaurants convenient. They are quick, offer a good value and have  predictable quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos-h.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xfp1/10354485_1503576039861887_341941421_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salad with proteins (chicken or beef) and without croutons/bread/corn/grains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burgers without buns, some places call them ‚Äúwrapped in lettuces‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos-a.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xaf1/917265_459351284170824_997640800_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs nothing wrong with treating yourself once in a while to a small side of french fries (with garlic, yum!) or a smoothie/milk shake. Even Mark Sisson says that we should‚Äôt be hard on ourselves all the time (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marksdailyapple.com/8020-principle/&quot;&gt;80/20 rule&lt;/a&gt;). Just be careful not to make it a daily (or for some even a weekly trip can be dangerous) meal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/927868_498328226951733_1006424496_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite joints are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.superdupersf.com/&quot;&gt;SuperDuper Burgers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chipotle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Panera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mixt Greens / Chop‚Äôt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;McDonald‚Äôs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico is only 9-11 hours driving from the Bay Area. It‚Äôs a relatively large port city that serves as tourist cruises port of call. It has nice Pacific Ocean views and great seafood. The commerce is thriving on the US border with street vendors, acrobats and windshield window washers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://scontent-a.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-prn/t51.2885-15/1963154_1423660997884988_706200877_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;

      <guid isPermaLink="true">http://azat.co/blog/the-crimean-war/</guid>
      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In lieu of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2014/ukraine/&quot;&gt;events&lt;/a&gt; that started in December 2013 and still are happening in Ukraine (originally part of the Russian Empire and then the USSR), events that resulted in Crimea becoming a part of Russian Federation, I picked up a book about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_War&quot;&gt;Crimean War&lt;/a&gt; of 1853-56. The book turned out to be a longer than I expected, about 600 pages, but I enjoyed every single page of it because the author gives such a good geopolitical picture of what was going on before and after the war, as well as the atmosphere and trends of the major part of the 19th century. The book is called &lt;strong&gt;The Crimean War: A History by Orlando Figes&lt;/strong&gt; and it‚Äôs available in &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1krSGWg&quot;&gt;Kindle on Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I vaguely remember the very brief coverage of the Crimean War during my high school history class: something about the heroism of soldiers and Russian backwards technologies. It was good to look at the events from the British author‚Äôs point of view. Here are the things the surprised and impressed me the most:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Crimean War was the first modern war which involved heavy industrialized manufacturing ‚Äî at least on the side of France and the British Empire ‚Äî and the attrition warfare closely resembled World War I.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The public opinion was the major factor influencing French, British and Russian rulers in entering and ending the conflict ‚Äî just like now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The war started for many geopolitical (weakening of the Ottoman Empire), populist (the British press was very anti-Russian) and personal agendas (Nicholas I believed in the holy mission and the third Rome idea, and Napoleon III needed a victory to increase his influence).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nobody liked the poor Turks, not even their French and British allies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There were highly effective and flamboyant French &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zouave&quot;&gt;Zouave troops&lt;/a&gt; after which the American Civil War Zouaves were modeled just a few years later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, not many things have changed over 160 years in terms of the influence of public opinion and attempts at controlling it. Back then, the British Empire had &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; press, but there was some censorship of photography and in the army, e.g., the officers writing about the horrors of the first winter were considered traitors by their commanders. Orlando writes that the French emperor Napoleon III had spies everywhere and a tight grip on the press with censorship. The same things were true for the Russian Tsar Nicholas I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that changed dramatically was the speed of communication. The news traveled very slowly during the Crimean War ‚Äî it took a few days in the beginning of the conflict for the news to reach its destination until the telegraph line was laid under the Black Sea (for the allies). Now, we can just sit in the comfort of our homes, scanning Twitter with the #Ukraine hashtag, and getting real-time updates, photos and even live streams of events miles away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Twitter stops indexing search results after a couple of days, so you might want to try Storify for historical searches, e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://storify.com/search?q=ukraine&quot;&gt;https://storify.com/search?q=ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pioneer Nation 2014, D.I.Y. Revolution and Oregon Adventure</title>

      <author></author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pioneer Nation conference was all about living your dream. It was held in Portland, Oregon. I was due for a vacation after &lt;a href=&quot;http://webapplog.com/growth-hacking-the-new-docusign-experience/&quot;&gt;DocuSign Momentum&lt;/a&gt; and always wanted to visit this city, so the excuse was perfect. It turned out to be a perfect rainy getaway from the tiresome dry, sunny, and hot Bay area winter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://azat.co/images/blog/1171929_1480333745528775_71596623_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tiny Alaska Airline plane from rainy Oakland, CA to rainy Portland, OR&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was headed to the inaugural Pioneer Nation 2014 conference. I found out about this event almost by accident. Firstly, a few people whose opinions I respect suggested the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worlddominationsummit.com/&quot;&gt;World Domination Summit&lt;/a&gt; which is another conference in Portland organized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisguillebeau.com/&quot;&gt;Chris Guillebeau&lt;/a&gt; et al. Chris is the author of inspirational &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0067TGSOK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0067TGSOK&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=rpjs-20&quot;&gt;The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future &lt;/a&gt;. I signed up for the sale notification to WDS, but missed the second ticket sale wave by only a few hours. I checked my email at night and 500 tickets were sold, with the email blast having just gone out that morning. What a high demand; good job, Chris! That‚Äôs how I learned about Pioneer Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme of PN is simple: create your dream job, escape 9-5, and be an entrepreneur. This is more in line with my mood than WDS, which is more general and not all about business. Also PN is smaller in attendance than WDS, which was held three times already (or something like that). Because of that, not getting a ticket to the World Domination Summit allowed me to come to Pioneer Nation, so the outcome was to my benefit. I‚Äôm happy about the &lt;em&gt;fortuna&lt;/em&gt; despite the former being a better cocktail party conversation starter than the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://azat.co/images/blog/915545_852898578070735_1051820088_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Nines lounge view on downtown Portland, OR&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Pioneer Nation, about 400 of us socialized, listened to talks, and applied what we learned right away at workshops. For those of you who have read/listened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0067TGSOK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B0067TGSOK&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=rpjs-20&quot;&gt;The $100 Startup: Reinvent the Way You Make a Living, Do What You Love, and Create a New Future &lt;/a&gt;, it‚Äôs a very good book with a lot of case studies and inspirational stories (We &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; love stories, right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed at a wonderful place in Kenton, which I later discovered belongs to and is run by entrepreneurs and Pioneer Nation volunteers! The Kenton neighborhood is famous for its statue of a lumberjack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before committing to the trip, I lowered my expectations, and the plan was to enjoy my vacation, visit Portland and &lt;strong&gt;take the train&lt;/strong&gt; (Coast Starlight) back to the Bay Area. But the event turned out really well. I learned quite a few cool new things, met with interesting and inspiring people and came back for tons of new ideas. My main take aways‚Äîbesides the nice swag that they gave us, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://nathanbarry.com/authority/&quot;&gt;a book&lt;/a&gt;(thank you Nathan Barry!), hoodie, mug and compass‚Äîare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a marketing plan and calendar, and be disciplined and strategic about them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video courses are huge right now. I rejected the &lt;a href=&quot;http://azat.co/pioneer-nation-2014-diy-revolution-and-oregon-adventure/packtpub.com&quot;&gt;PacktPub&lt;/a&gt; offer to do the Express.js video course in order to produce mine independently&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris Brogan‚Äôs quote: ‚ÄúUsually it‚Äôs not the book-smartest who succeed, because those people never start, but the other people: they don‚Äôt know stuff, but they start anyway‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just a side note: Portland has good coffee and lots and lots of organic juice bars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The path to new age entrepreneurship is doable and doesn‚Äôt take long: most of the speakers been doing this entrepreneurial thing only for about 2-4 years. In some of the break-out sessions, speakers were sitting in on the other sessions and learning something themselves!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://azat.co/images/blog/1725358_263223593850349_1742201531_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I‚Äôm full of motivation and have a new mini-community of creative risk-takers. Go pioneers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://azat.co/images/blog/40d93f52b62211e3bc1b0eccfd8aa9b3_8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my way back, I took the Coast Starlight train for the sake of adventure, scenic views and ability to get started on my new book &lt;a href=&quot;http://progwriter.com&quot;&gt;ProgWriter&lt;/a&gt;. The lack of WiFi internet didn‚Äôt bother me because I had MoFi (but never needed to use it). I actually found it better not to be interrupted by the Internet research when I was writing. Needless to say, the ride was spectacular and surprisingly convenient: there was more legroom in coach than in a business class airplane seat. The conversations and people who travel on trains were amazing. I met with a city counsel of Bend, OR (a town near Mount Bachelor ski resort in the middle of Oregon), and she told me about their BYOJ (bring your own job) and startup initiatives. By dusk when we were crossing the Cascades, there was snow and scenic views. Maybe I should travel with Amtrak more often?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm starting my personal blog and this is its first post. This blog unlike webapplog will contain &lt;strong&gt;zero coding&lt;/strong&gt;, and lots of musings, instagrams and rants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might guess that blog is built with Node.js-powered Wintersmith static site generator. The Ghost just can‚Äôt compete with the simplier set up that Wintersmith has.&lt;/p&gt;
