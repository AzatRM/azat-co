          <section class="content"><p>I’m 3/4 into the Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (<span class="caps">MSIE</span>) degree program at HEC Paris, and it is a time to write a reflection on my experience. I’ll think about whether it was worth the time and effort, and of course if I’m getting what I&nbsp;expected.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that a lot of universities and colleges moved to virtual classes. We, at <span class="caps">MSIE</span>, had a 100% virtual/online program from the beginning. Our cohort is number four which means HEC and Coursera figured out a lot of issues that they might have had before, like in any version 1.0 product. My cohort started in Jun 2019 so this post mark a year into the&nbsp;program.</p>

<li><em>Social Entrepreneurship <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Changemaking</em>, </li>
<li><em>Scaling Up Operations</em>, </li>
<li><em>Marketing through Social Media</em>, </li>
<li><em>Team Working</em>, </li>
<li><em>How to Create a Business Plan</em>&nbsp;and</li>
<li><em>Fundamentals of Negotiation</em>. </li>
</ol>
<p>That’s a lot of courses in a span of several month. There were a lot of useful tidbits, insights and tips. Too many to write about right now. Ergo, I’ll talk in more details about the latest course which I finished today—<em>Fundamentals of Negotiation</em>.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>In English, to wish someone a nice and tasty meal is said with “enjoy your meal”. I never liked this phrase because it sounds like a command—enjoy! And if you don’t obey my command then there will be repercussions. Of course, it’s silly to think of this phrase this way but still the “enjoy your meal” phrase sounds too harsh and not elegant. Maybe people try to remind each other that they should enjoy their food instead of gulping fast food on the go or chowing down a salad while browsing Facebook and answering&nbsp;emails?</p>

I’ve taken two new courses: Business strategy and Strategic Management of Innovation. They were somewhat related which was good for building a broad knowledge, because several concepts and topics were used and discussed from different angles in both courses. When I was a schoolboy, I liked strategy games like chess, Civilization and Command <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Conquer. I had to balance building roads and factories with investment in defense and military troops. As with these games, in business it’s all about the&nbsp;strategy. </p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/hec-paris/">Why I'm Getting a Second Master's Degree from HEC Paris</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/hec-paris/hec-paris.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Two months ago, I applied and was accepted to a master’s program at a prestigious business school (ranked #2), <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris. The degree is title <em>Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship</em> (<span class="caps">MSIE</span>). It has 10 normal courses, 10 practical project-based courses and one large team project. The master’s program lasts about one year and a half. Thus the program ends in 2020. However the graduation will be in 2021, because HEC has only one graduation ceremony which is held in its beautiful Paris&nbsp;campus.</p>
<p>I finished my first Master’s degree in 2007. It was Master of Science in Information Systems Technology from the University of Northern Virginia. I don’t like traditional universities and degrees. I’m a strong proponent of modern online education like Node University or Udacity. I taught at the Hack Reactor coding academy and I’m a huge fan of vocational schools that teach practical trades as oppose to abstract and theoretical knowledge unnecessary for the real-world jobs. Needless to say, that there are a lot of materials available online via YouTube and blogs. So it might come as a surprise that I’m getting a second masters degree. However, I decided to commit to getting a second Master of Science degree for the following&nbsp;reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivation: When you pay 10s of thousands of dollars or euros you are more motivated to continue and finish the&nbsp;studies</li>
<li>Focus and pre-filter: Someone with a good reputation already did the selection for me. I avoid ads or possible distractions form web surfing when I’m on&nbsp;Coursera.</li>
<li>European perspective: Living in San Francisco and Silicon Valley area for the last seven years I understand that we live in a bubble here. <span class="caps">SF</span> is not the entire world which has other, bigger and more real, problems. It’s nice to hear and learn another perspective on business and&nbsp;innovation.</li>
<li>Content: Things change fast and after 12 years, it’ll be nice to become a student again and get a nice broad overview of current methods and techniques in entrepreneurship in a nice distraction-free format (reading blogs or watching YouTube is a&nbsp;pain!).</li>
<li>Experience: the <span class="caps">MSIE</span> program is mostly (50%+) project based which gives actual experience instead of just being abstract&nbsp;lectures.</li>
<li>Brand and Network: <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris is number 2 business school in Europe with a large and global presence, brand and alumni network. Brand is great because it attracts best student (for peer learning), best coaches (for projects) and best faculty (for&nbsp;lectures).</li>
<li>Convenience: The <span class="caps">MSIE</span> program is 100% online with weekly live calls, chat rooms, forums and online proctored exams. I don’t like the idea of being confined to one location and a set time for lectures for the next two years. With this format, I can travel often or even more to a new place all&nbsp;together.</li>
<li>Relatively cheap: The <span class="caps">MSIE</span>, HEC Paris program cost only 20,000 euros comparing to ~$30-40,000 USD for master’s from Harvard Extension or $150,000 USD for Wharton&nbsp;EMBA.</li>
</ul>
<p>I looked at other Master’s programs. In particular, I researched Wharton Executive <span class="caps">MBA</span> (WEMBA) in San Francisco. They fly all the faculty from Pennsylvania ever other week. I even took a few courses form the same program. The requirement of being tied and having to come to SF every other week for two years is too limiting for me. The price is very&nbsp;steel.</p>
<p>I looked at master degrees from Harvard Extension and even took a course from them. I didn’t like their approach. It’s too rigid with the focus on minute details, fact and rote memorization. The requirement for home assignment for some courses are too arcane (must be only in <span class="caps">MS</span> Word with certain font size and margins). The fact that they require students to come to every live webinar every week (missing even a single webinar is not allowed) is very depressing and limiting. The platform is clunky (can’t download videos for online&nbsp;viewing).</p>
<p>I like the <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris uses Coursera which is one of the best platforms for online courses. The MSIE content is relatively new and the approach is more practical. I’m in cohort 4 which means that it’s only fourth batch of students. If I’m not mistaken, cohorts 2 and 3 are still studying and haven’t graduated. Being in the 4<span class="ord">th</span> cohort means that university and Coursera ironed out all the kicks and perfected the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>The application process was lengthy but totally doable: few essays, video cover letter, bio, experience and two references (done by email). The Coursera and <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris staff are responsive and all the logistics ran smooth so far. The students have incredible backgrounds and I’m sure we’ll learn a great deal form each other in addition to the lectures and&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>I’ll try to keep writing about my journey through this innovative and practical Master of Science&nbsp;program.</p>
