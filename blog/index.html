            <h2><a href="/blog/hec-paris-8/">My HEC Paris Journey, Part VIII: The Team Project</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>The team project for my master’s degree in Innovation and Entreprenurship from <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris took about a year. First, we were a team of four people. Then one person dropped out of the program and we were left just three of us: two guys from Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area and one guy from&nbsp;France. </p>
<p>Anyone could have pitched their own idea to the whole cohort so that the most popular ideas attract teammates to collaborate. Some team had as many as six&nbsp;people! </p>
<p>We started to work on the idea of a network of smart airpurifiers but then pivoted to an idea of a smart air quality meter. The reason was that the market for air purifiers is saturated and margins are low, while the smart air quality meter market is a blue ocean and high margins (albeit a lower price point than the purifiers). It still bogles my mind why giants like HoneyWell, Germguardian and Dyson won’t provide a WiFi connected air quality meter with their purifiers. In other words, our project was more like a feature than an entire new product. But that was okay since we just wanted to practice and we didn’t want to make it a real business because we already had full time jobs and/or our own existing&nbsp;businesses. </p>
<p>Each month, we had milestone like creation of a business plane financial projection, or marketing plan. We met every week to discuss the assignments and to coordinate our work. Then we worked asynchronously throughout the week on the assignment, usually each of us worked on a separate part that we agreed on&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>We had a coach with whom we’ve met a lot initially but then stopped meeting closer to the end of the program because we gelled well together and only needed the input on the final&nbsp;pitch. </p>
<p>The final pitch was pre-recorded and limited to 3 minutes to avoid abusing judges. By the way, 3 minutes is 10x-20x less than a typical startup would get at a <span class="caps">VC</span> meeting (that is 30-60 minutes). We each recorded about a minutes, I edited the videos to remove ums and ahs and to insert slides. I then sent the uploaded video to HEC. On the day of the presentation, we joined the call and watched our pre-recorded video. Then, we answered a few questions from the judges, who in turn provided scoring for our team project which is a heavy 50% of the degree&nbsp;score.</p>
<p>Our final project was well received. The pitch deck looked very polished thanks to a designer of one of our teammates. I created a website and a signup form to attract early buyers of our product. So we had early validation of our idea. We’ve contacted oversees manufactures to get the specs, terms and cost&nbsp;right. </p>
<p>It’s hard to simulate a real startup in the format and with the limitation of a degree. However, this team project allowed us to come as close as possible to a creation of a new product and maybe a new business. We got another “badge” in our portfolio to build the skills and confidence to act in real&nbsp;world.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>Today, I just finished the last (20<span class="ord">th</span>) course for the <span class="caps">MSIE</span> program. The course was on Venture Capital and Private Equity and it concludes the academic part of the masters program. I wrote academic because the courses weren’t just theoretical. We did had a lot of practice preparing our assignments and working on business&nbsp;cases. </p>
<p>Now, the only thing is left is to finish the team project that my team of three worked on for the pretty much the entire year. My team and I have to present the pitch deck for our product to the jury in a similar way how the startups pitch investors. We’ll get our grades and finish our Master of Science&nbsp;degree.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>I’m 3/4 into the Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (<span class="caps">MSIE</span>) degree program at HEC Paris, and it is a time to write a reflection on my experience. I’ll think about whether it was worth the time and effort, and of course if I’m getting what I&nbsp;expected.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that a lot of universities and colleges moved to virtual classes. We, at <span class="caps">MSIE</span>, had a 100% virtual/online program from the beginning. Our cohort is number four which means HEC and Coursera figured out a lot of issues that they might have had before, like in any version 1.0 product. My cohort started in Jun 2019 so this post mark a year into the&nbsp;program.</p>

<li><em>Social Entrepreneurship <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Changemaking</em>, </li>
<li><em>Scaling Up Operations</em>, </li>
<li><em>Marketing through Social Media</em>, </li>
<li><em>Team Working</em>, </li>
<li><em>How to Create a Business Plan</em>&nbsp;and</li>
<li><em>Fundamentals of Negotiation</em>. </li>
</ol>
<p>That’s a lot of courses in a span of several month. There were a lot of useful tidbits, insights and tips. Too many to write about right now. Ergo, I’ll talk in more details about the latest course which I finished today—<em>Fundamentals of Negotiation</em>.</p>

          <section class="content"><p>In English, to wish someone a nice and tasty meal is said with “enjoy your meal”. I never liked this phrase because it sounds like a command—enjoy! And if you don’t obey my command then there will be repercussions. Of course, it’s silly to think of this phrase this way but still the “enjoy your meal” phrase sounds too harsh and not elegant. Maybe people try to remind each other that they should enjoy their food instead of gulping fast food on the go or chowing down a salad while browsing Facebook and answering&nbsp;emails?</p>

          <section class="content"><p>It’s time to write a new blog post about my experience in the <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris Master of Science program. I’ve taken two new courses: Business strategy and Strategic Management of Innovation. They were somewhat related which was good for building a broad knowledge, because several concepts and topics were used and discussed from different angles in both courses. When I was a schoolboy, I liked strategy games like chess, Civilization and Command <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Conquer. I had to balance building roads and factories with investment in defense and military troops. As with these games, in business it’s all about the&nbsp;strategy. </p>
<p>Let me first tell me about the Business Strategy&nbsp;course.</p>
