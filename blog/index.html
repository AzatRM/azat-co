            <h2><a href="/blog/rich/">Disadvantages of Rich People</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Rich people can and do risk more than ordinary people. And they do so intentionally. This puts them at a disadvantage. Ironically, these risks and dangers are rarely experienced by middle class or poor people, because these risky activities require expensive equipment, machines or gear. For example, the following activities present increased&nbsp;dangers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Driving sports/fast&nbsp;cars</li>
<li>Riding&nbsp;motorcycles</li>
<li><span class="caps">SCUBA</span>&nbsp;diving</li>
<li>Skiing and&nbsp;snowboarding</li>
<li>Sky&nbsp;diving</li>
<li>Piloting planes or&nbsp;helicopters</li>
<li>Traveling to exotic locations (full of&nbsp;diseases)</li>
<li>Over&nbsp;eating </li>
<li>Over indulgence in alcoholic drinks (or other addictive&nbsp;substances)</li>
<li>Partying</li>
<li>Experimental medical and health&nbsp;procedures </li>
<li>Using dubious biohacking&nbsp;gadgets</li>
<li>Attending cult-like gurus and&nbsp;seminars</li>
</ul>
<p>Other activities are huge time sucks that require mental energy (headspace) on maintenance <em>and</em> increased&nbsp;worries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partaking in difficult hobbies, e.g,. golfing,&nbsp;surfing</li>
<li>Buying&nbsp;cars</li>
<li>Buying large houses and buying extra&nbsp;homes</li>
<li>Buying gadgets, e.g., yachts,&nbsp;RVs</li>
<li>Participating in fame events (<span class="caps">TV</span> interviews, conference keynotes,&nbsp;etc.)</li>
<li>Chasing fashion and&nbsp;brands</li>
</ul>
<p>The mentioned activities cost a lot of money and take up a lot of time. Yet statistically these activities often lead to increased risk of serious injuries and fatalities. In a way, rich people are more at risk and have less time than ordinary people. They also more worried and distracted by having to think about all those items (i.e., lack of&nbsp;headspace). </p>
<p>Of course, some hobbies help to escape or add joy. The tricky part is the balance. And of course, reading a book or watching a <span class="caps">TV</span> which is super cheap or free is less dangerous than riding a&nbsp;motorcycle.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, people get rich because they are lucky and spend time working. But then they get unlucky (die early or injure themselves) or just don’t have enough time or headspace. It’s funny how a lot of people want to get rich to partake in some of the aforementioned activities. But they don’t realize that they would be at a disadvantage. If you are a rich person, try to avoid these&nbsp;disadvantages. </p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I’m 3/4 into the Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (<span class="caps">MSIE</span>) degree program at HEC Paris, and it is a time to write a reflection on my experience. I’ll think about whether it was worth the time and effort, and of course if I’m getting what I&nbsp;expected.</p>
<p>It’s worth mentioning that a lot of universities and colleges moved to virtual classes. We, at <span class="caps">MSIE</span>, had a 100% virtual/online program from the beginning. Our cohort is number four which means HEC and Coursera figured out a lot of issues that they might have had before, like in any version 1.0 product. My cohort started in Jun 2019 so this post mark a year into the&nbsp;program.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>Time flies. I’m already about two-thirds into the MSc Innovation and Entrepreneurship program at <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris. The previous post I wrote was <a href="http://azat.co/blog/hec-paris-4/">My <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris Journey, Part IV: Organize and Incentivize</a>. From the time I published it, I’ve taken these seven&nbsp;courses: </p>
<ol>
<li><em>Design Thinking</em>, </li>
<li><em>Social Entrepreneurship <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Changemaking</em>, </li>
<li><em>Scaling Up Operations</em>, </li>
<li><em>Marketing through Social Media</em>, </li>
<li><em>Team Working</em>, </li>
<li><em>How to Create a Business Plan</em>&nbsp;and</li>
<li><em>Fundamentals of Negotiation</em>. </li>
</ol>
<p>That’s a lot of courses in a span of several month. There were a lot of useful tidbits, insights and tips. Too many to write about right now. Ergo, I’ll talk in more details about the latest course which I finished today—<em>Fundamentals of Negotiation</em>.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/mmat/">MMAT: My Learning Approach</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>In our day and age, learning is more important than ever because things change so rapidly. I learned a taught a lot of things during my career which led me to discover that the best and the most effective learning method is to use <span class="caps">MMAT</span>: Motivation, Methodology, Action and&nbsp;Time. </p>
<p>Motivation is number one. It’s the answer to a “why?” question. Without it, we won’t do anything else. People who constantly remind themselves of their WHYs are more motivated and can overcome any other difficulties like finding the best&nbsp;methodology. </p>
<p>A good methodology (or learning structure and material) is important because without a good strategy and know-how we will drown in a sea of ubiquitous information. We simply will never accomplish our learning goals due to analysis paralysis. And yes, sometimes it take a lot of time to find the best methodology. Don’t get caught up in never ending search. Perfect is the enemy of done so just pick something good enough and stick with it for a&nbsp;while.</p>
<p>Next is the action. Action is what separates theory from the real results. Action clarifies. It shows what’s working and what’s not, what’s important and what’s not. Action brings up new questions. Action turns new learning into habits and then into identity (which makes things automatic — a second&nbsp;nature). </p>
<p>There are so many fake teachers who never worked in the industry and yet teach people business, marketing, finance, computer science, literature. A lot of their teaching is plain <span class="caps">BS</span> that’s better to ignore because it can actually harm the real&nbsp;doers. </p>
<p>Lastly, time. Time is needed to soak up the skills, to ruminate, to muse on them to come up with novel ways to think and work. Sometimes it’s more practice and action. Sometimes it’s stepping away and then coming back to the new skill after a short break (e.g., space&nbsp;repetition). </p>
<p>The bottom line is that once we’ve acquired the methodology, we should aim to take a lot of action. A lot! And we ought to be prepared to wait, be patient and give time for our new skills to sharpen. It can take years. The luckiest will master the skills and they’ll become second nature. We can remind ourselves of our motivation to keep&nbsp;going.</p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/nice-meal/">Wishing a Nice Meal (in Five Languages)</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>In English, to wish someone a nice and tasty meal is said with “enjoy your meal”. I never liked this phrase because it sounds like a command—enjoy! And if you don’t obey my command then there will be repercussions. Of course, it’s silly to think of this phrase this way but still the “enjoy your meal” phrase sounds too harsh and not elegant. Maybe people try to remind each other that they should enjoy their food instead of gulping fast food on the go or chowing down a salad while browsing Facebook and answering&nbsp;emails?</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why a lot of English-speaking Americans prefer the French “bon appétit”. It literally means good appetite but implies I wish you a nice appetite. I use it sometimes but if I think about it more then why would I want to wish someone a good appetite? Maybe they are on a diet of some sort and actually try to eat less, not more? Maybe I should wish them that they have a less of an&nbsp;appetite?</p>
<p>The Russian phrase “приятного аппетита” just mimics the French phrase so nothings new here. French and Russian cultures often share a lot of&nbsp;similarities.</p>
<p>I really like the Spanish phrase “buen provecho”. It literally translates into make sure you’re taking a good benefit (of the food). The translation is clumsy because there’s no direct analog in English to the Spanish verb provechar. I really like this verb. It means take advantage or take benefit. In English it’s a phrase of at least two words but in Spanish you can say in one word. Usually Spanish is more compact than&nbsp;English. </p>
<p>Funny enough, ever time I hear buen provecho I remember a car sale commercial ad on radio that talked about taking advantage of some sale. :) So sometimes, in the <span class="caps">USA</span> I say buen provecho to English speaking Americans. If the French phrase is common in the USA, why not make the Spanish phrase popular too. Maybe we can even import the verb provechar into English&nbsp;language?!</p>
<p>Lastly, in Tatar one of the phrases “ашыгыз тәмле булсын” or just “тәмле булсын” which means wishing that your food will be tasty. I think that’s the best phrase. The bonus that it won’t lead to over eating either. You can enjoy the tasty food but stop when you’re full (no need for a big&nbsp;appetite).</p>
<p><span class="caps">PS</span>: Next time you wish “enjoy my meal” or “have a safe travel” just think about it. It sounds like I typically don’t enjoy my food or try to go on adventures and put myself in danger but this time I’ll have to be extra joyful and&nbsp;safe.</p>

I’ve taken two new courses: Business strategy and Strategic Management of Innovation. They were somewhat related which was good for building a broad knowledge, because several concepts and topics were used and discussed from different angles in both courses. When I was a schoolboy, I liked strategy games like chess, Civilization and Command <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Conquer. I had to balance building roads and factories with investment in defense and military troops. As with these games, in business it’s all about the&nbsp;strategy. </p>

            <h2><a href="/blog/hec-paris/">Why I'm Getting a Second Master's Degree from HEC Paris</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section class="content"><p><img src="/blog/hec-paris/hec-paris.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Two months ago, I applied and was accepted to a master’s program at a prestigious business school (ranked #2), <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris. The degree is title <em>Master of Science in Innovation and Entrepreneurship</em> (<span class="caps">MSIE</span>). It has 10 normal courses, 10 practical project-based courses and one large team project. The master’s program lasts about one year and a half. Thus the program ends in 2020. However the graduation will be in 2021, because HEC has only one graduation ceremony which is held in its beautiful Paris&nbsp;campus.</p>
<p>I finished my first Master’s degree in 2007. It was Master of Science in Information Systems Technology from the University of Northern Virginia. I don’t like traditional universities and degrees. I’m a strong proponent of modern online education like Node University or Udacity. I taught at the Hack Reactor coding academy and I’m a huge fan of vocational schools that teach practical trades as oppose to abstract and theoretical knowledge unnecessary for the real-world jobs. Needless to say, that there are a lot of materials available online via YouTube and blogs. So it might come as a surprise that I’m getting a second masters degree. However, I decided to commit to getting a second Master of Science degree for the following&nbsp;reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motivation: When you pay 10s of thousands of dollars or euros you are more motivated to continue and finish the&nbsp;studies</li>
<li>Focus and pre-filter: Someone with a good reputation already did the selection for me. I avoid ads or possible distractions form web surfing when I’m on&nbsp;Coursera.</li>
<li>European perspective: Living in San Francisco and Silicon Valley area for the last seven years I understand that we live in a bubble here. <span class="caps">SF</span> is not the entire world which has other, bigger and more real, problems. It’s nice to hear and learn another perspective on business and&nbsp;innovation.</li>
<li>Content: Things change fast and after 12 years, it’ll be nice to become a student again and get a nice broad overview of current methods and techniques in entrepreneurship in a nice distraction-free format (reading blogs or watching YouTube is a&nbsp;pain!).</li>
<li>Experience: the <span class="caps">MSIE</span> program is mostly (50%+) project based which gives actual experience instead of just being abstract&nbsp;lectures.</li>
<li>Brand and Network: <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris is number 2 business school in Europe with a large and global presence, brand and alumni network. Brand is great because it attracts best student (for peer learning), best coaches (for projects) and best faculty (for&nbsp;lectures).</li>
<li>Convenience: The <span class="caps">MSIE</span> program is 100% online with weekly live calls, chat rooms, forums and online proctored exams. I don’t like the idea of being confined to one location and a set time for lectures for the next two years. With this format, I can travel often or even more to a new place all&nbsp;together.</li>
<li>Relatively cheap: The <span class="caps">MSIE</span>, HEC Paris program cost only 20,000 euros comparing to ~$30-40,000 USD for master’s from Harvard Extension or $150,000 USD for Wharton&nbsp;EMBA.</li>
</ul>
<p>I looked at other Master’s programs. In particular, I researched Wharton Executive <span class="caps">MBA</span> (WEMBA) in San Francisco. They fly all the faculty from Pennsylvania ever other week. I even took a few courses form the same program. The requirement of being tied and having to come to SF every other week for two years is too limiting for me. The price is very&nbsp;steel.</p>
<p>I looked at master degrees from Harvard Extension and even took a course from them. I didn’t like their approach. It’s too rigid with the focus on minute details, fact and rote memorization. The requirement for home assignment for some courses are too arcane (must be only in <span class="caps">MS</span> Word with certain font size and margins). The fact that they require students to come to every live webinar every week (missing even a single webinar is not allowed) is very depressing and limiting. The platform is clunky (can’t download videos for online&nbsp;viewing).</p>
<p>I like the <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris uses Coursera which is one of the best platforms for online courses. The MSIE content is relatively new and the approach is more practical. I’m in cohort 4 which means that it’s only fourth batch of students. If I’m not mistaken, cohorts 2 and 3 are still studying and haven’t graduated. Being in the 4<span class="ord">th</span> cohort means that university and Coursera ironed out all the kicks and perfected the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>The application process was lengthy but totally doable: few essays, video cover letter, bio, experience and two references (done by email). The Coursera and <span class="caps">HEC</span> Paris staff are responsive and all the logistics ran smooth so far. The students have incredible backgrounds and I’m sure we’ll learn a great deal form each other in addition to the lectures and&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>I’ll try to keep writing about my journey through this innovative and practical Master of Science&nbsp;program.</p>

          </header>
          <section class="content"><p>I truly believe that human brains didn’t evolve to process complex data. Human conscious mind can only hold three, maybe five, seven max for some geniuses, items at a time. Because of that, I have a very optimistic belief when I’m faced with something complex and overwhelming: nothing complex is possible to build or comprehend. It’s optimistic because I know that everything can be broken down into small&nbsp;components.</p>
<p>For example, a large corporation or huge country are run by small hierarchical groups of three to seven people. Any large computer system can be broken down to modules, submodules and procedures inside of these submodules. When faced with a new undertaking, a study or a seemingly complex system, I remind myself to keep things simple stupid, or to keep them simple,&nbsp;stupid.</p>
